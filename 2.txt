$88,000 in profit and over 1,200 units sold and this is me shipping off some products to Amazon having fun a couple years back pumping some stuff out of the warehouse and if you want to see some real life examples of everyday people who have helped get started selling on Amazon meet Max so max graduated college about 2 years ago and started selling on Amazon about a year ago part time even with a 9 to-5 while finishing his MBA program he was able to make $50,000 in profit in just one single month in his first year if he can do it on limited
time so can you I'm so proud of Max and everything he's got going on and I want to create some more success stories today this was us hanging out about six months ago Max actually learned about selling Amazon from one of his college buddies Patrick who's now also selling six figures years a month on Amazon and had gone through all my content this was us hanging out about 6 months ago at an Amazon Seller conference in New Jersey so hopefully as you guys are growing your Amazon businesses I'd love to
interact get to know you guys and maybe see you at a conference as well and when I tell you there's no excuses to get started even if you have a 9 to5 even if you're in college right now meet Sam so Sam about a year ago was a stay-at-home mom looking for a side hustle she gave birth to a newborn and had her first $10,000 profit month in the same month it's crazy what's possible with selling on Amazon when you're stay consistent work hard and stay persistent crazy obviously most people don't get that
type of results fast it just shows you guys there's no excuses and anything's possible if you really get to it and Sam kept going with that she grew crazy fast this was during Q4 which is the best time of the year over 280k in revenue and over $50,000 profit in one single month or my boy Peter's a working professional from Wisconsin who started his Amazon side hustle about a year ago while working his remote 9 to-5 he made over $115,000 profit in his fourth month going through the same content you guys
are getting completely free he now enjoys the freedom of so many desire I'm so proud of Peter and all the other Amazon Seller success stories I've been lucky enough to help create the Amazon Seller Community is awesome this was actually a Meetup we did in King of Prussia Pennsylvania during December right before the biggest time of the year started and it's so cool getting to meet and interact with the Amazon community live and you'll notice this throughout the free courses one of the main themes of my journey was connecting
masterminding and building with other sellers whether you're in PA Los Ang Angeles Wisconsin Utah wherever there's other Amazon sellers and it's a lot of fun networking masterminding building with them hundreds of success stories and I want you guys to be next this was back at an Amazon Seller conference in March lucky enough to hang out with some students in person so I want to make sure you guys are fully prepared to digest and more importantly take action on this information you guys are going
to see today so why Amazon FBA makes so much sense Amazon is a $ 1.92 trillion company and they allow us to sell on their platform in November of 2023 amazon.com does over 500 billion a year in total revenue and the crazy part is over 60% of products sold on Amazon come from third party sellers everyday people like you and I on our laptops and this opportunity is so important because everyone you know shops on Amazon but 99.
99% of people have zero clue that everyday people like you and I are building big businesses selling on Amazon and I also saw an article that said 43% of Amazon sellers have made over $100,000 in Revenue which is pretty cool as well but who am I so I'm a 25-year-old dude who changed his life my first year out of college and sold over a million doar and made over $100,000 profit in just my first 10 months my second month once I really started scaling up was over $6,000 in profit and after 6 months I was consistently doing around $155,000 a month in profit I had
to learn the hard way so I'm here today to help you guys save time money and mistakes and I'm not joking about Q4 guys like it's absolutely crazy what happens with Black Friday Christmas December all the other holidays in the fourth quarter year this this was my biggest month ever almost half a million dollar in trailing 30-day Revenue which was over $80,000 in net profit in my pocket this free course is going to give you everything you need to know to get started today so make sure you guys take
notes and like I said the time stamps are in the description if you want to jump around to any other times this free course is going to cover how Amazon FBA works the four different business models all the different terms you need to know how to get your business setup correctly beginner frequently asked questions what I wish I knew when I got started that's a subject I really like so I can help you guys save time and mistakes what tools to use so what softwares do I use to run my own 7 figureure Amazon
business how to get ungated plus a big list of free auto unate products as well as product analysis winning product examples over two hours of live product research how to make items good listing and shipping as well as scaling tips and a bunch of other free value so make sure you guys take notes remove distractions and take action on this info what I'm going be showing you guys how to do today is Amazon Allin Arbitrage buying big name brand at a discount then flipping them on Amazon for a profit finding an Adidas product on coals for
$10 that sells for $30 on Amazon and you keep $10 profit after shipping fees and product cost there's a bunch of different ways to sell on Amazon for example private label which is buying stuff from China this takes a lot more time and requires a lot more capital and it's really risky because once you buy a generic product from China for $2 that someone else is selling for $12 on Amazon no one mentions that those products don't have reviews customers aren't just randomly going to buy them you're going to need to spend ads you're
going to need to get professional photography you're going to need to do copyrighting on the listing and that's overall just a lot more complicated for beginners compared to buying a Lego product that has proven sales sister on Amazon that we can see it's been profitable for a while it has reviews it has proven demand and Amazon just rotates the sales to everyone that's priced competitively on that listing so private label does work but it's significantly more risky and expensive for beginners and I wouldn't recommend
it you're also going to need way more Capital to get started with PL another one is Amazon wholesale which is basically buying products in bulk directly from the manufacturer or the distributor the problem with this is that it has big lead times and it's riskier because it takes more Capital so you might have to put $3,000 into one product meanwhile with online and Retail Arbitrage you can start out way less risky and just buy a couple of something the third one is Drop Shipping which is not allowed on Amazon anyone telling you
it is is lying please don't listen to them Drop Shipping is a terrible customer EXP experience compared to shipping your product off in bulk to Amazon where they can then fulfill it to the customer via Amazon Prime if you're Drop Shipping products the customer is going to receive a product they paid $30 for on Amazon with a receipt from Walmart for $12 and they're going to be pissed off and rightfully so and then the fourth one is what we're talking about today online and Retail Arbitrage online Arbitrage like I said is buying
from cools.com Retail Arbitrage is going in stort of cools this is less scalable but faster to make money and I totally recommend doing both of your complete beginner there's also used book Arbitrage which is pretty similar to Retail Arbitrage which takes basically no money but it's very very difficult to scale online and Retail Arbitrage is the least risk highest upside way to start and that's why I recommend getting going with that because you're probably where I was a few years ago without much
capital and you're not completely sure if this works so start out nice small and low rist build proof of concept from there and scale up at your own speed different terms you guys are going to need to know I'd recommend taking notes on these cuz you are going to need to know all of them how you do need all these if you're going to be successful selling on Amazon the first one is FBA this stands for fulfillment by Amazon this is the Fulfillment method of selling products on Amazon where you ship the products off in bulk to the
Amazon FBA warehouse and they handle the rest fulfilling the individual order customer service everything like that the second one is going to be Merchant fulfilled which is shipping the product directly to the customer we're going to talk a lot about that later in the free course all you need to know about fbm right now is it's shipping the product directly to the customer individually not sending it off and bulk to Amazon Q4 is the last months of the year of the holiday season where Halloween Black
Friday Cyber Monday and Christmas happens the buy box that's the Buy It Now option on Amazon it rotates between the different sellers this is where you want to be as much as possible as a seller and later in the free course I'm going to show you guys how to get the buy box virtual assistance they'll be full training on some of the more advanced stuff later virtual assistance prep centers Etc this is basically offshore toal employees that you can help run your Amazon business for 3 to 10 10 bucks an hour in countries like
the Philippines and Morocco and Pakistan for stuff like product sourcing admin work Outreach to suppliers Etc this typically makes sense around 20 to 30k a month in Revenue prep centers are third-party warehouses that'll intake your inventory and process it to FBA for you you'll sometime hear these referred to as 3pls in e-commerce as well prep centers will save you a ton of time and money because you don't actually have to the packaging work yourself which makes it a ton easier to scale your business
this typically makes sense around 500 units per all in Arbitrage is buying products online to flip and keepa is a product research tool that shows you supply demand and price action over time we're going to do a full keepa and seller amp tutorial in a little bit seller amp is our product research tool that shows the exact net profit and helps you find more items it can be really confusing when you're a complete beginner dealing with Amazon fees and shipping seller amp makes your life a lot easier number 10 is sales rank this
is a number assigned to every product to show demand the lower the sales rank the better I'd recommend staying below 150,000 sales rank for the most part sales rank does change intraday so seller am's going to show you what the average sales rank is over time and it's going to make your life a lot easier cuz the last thing you want to do is buy a bunch of products that don't actually sell fast luckily that is easy to tell and we're going to go through that in the product analysis section Retail
Arbitrage is buying stuff in store to flip it private label is buying an unbranded item and branding it the typical Alibaba buying stuff from China method you guys see a bolo is a hot item it stands for beyond the lookout for so like a super popping product in the Amazon community and 14 as stands for Amazon standard identification number this is what you're going to see on seller amp and in the URL it's a unique number given to every product on Amazon that differentiates it from others some beginner frequently asked questions can
I start this part-time absolutely Peter got started part-time Max got started part-time Sam gave birth and made 10K profit in one single month even if you have a 9 to-5 job or in college you can totally get started selling on Amazon part-time that's what I got started with how much Capital does it take to get started we're going to do a full budget breakdown in a couple minutes but you pretty much need to get started with whatever you guys got I started reselling with like 160 bucks so you kind of just got to start with what you
got and figure it out we are going to do a full Budget break down line by line of everything you need for Amazon OA in a few minutes though do I need to negotiate with Chinese Flyers absolutely not that's the beauty of this business there's no cold calling no cold emailing you're just finding discounted name brand products on big websites like CO's Walmart and Target ordering them to yourself then shipping them off in bulk to the Amazon FBA warehouse and they handle the rest what are the Target
profit margins between 10 and 20% it could be a little bit higher if you want to do a lot more Retail Arbitrage however that's pretty standard for an Arbitrage business in 2024 and Beyond obviously the higher profit margin the better though warning finding deals online will also make you allergic to paying full price for proc you are going to sit so you are going to end up saving a ton of money in other parts of your life with how good you're going to be at getting cheap product now is there a way to automate the process sometimes right
virtual assistants prep Centers do make your life easier however no businesses passive income please don't believe people on the internet that are telling you you can get rich with no work selling on Amazon it's far from True do I need tons of space to start the cool part about this business model is that you're not storing inventory yourself you're sending stuff off in bulk to the Amazon warehouse so you absolutely don't need tons of space to start although it definitely doesn't hurt do I need to do
customer service the clutch part is with Amazon FBA Amazon handles the customer service so you're not really going to be responsible for most of that I heard it's impossible to get approval to sell big Brands and categories that is absolutely not true in a couple minutes I'm going to show you exactly how to get that step by step in terms of M gating how do you get paid by Amazon Amazon pays out every two weeks through what they call their account level reserve and then once you've built up consistent
sales history for like 6 months you can also upgrade to daily payouts as well they deposit directly to your bank account you don't need some fancy business bank account to get started although it can make sense to split up personal and business bank accounts eventually if you're really serious how do you get your products to the Amazon warehouse so unfortunately you can't ship directly from the supplier to Amazon in 99.
9% of cases typically people talking about that either have been doing it for years or just don't know how this actually works you're going to order the products from websites like Co to yourself or to your prep Center which we'll talk about later and then either you or them are going to ship the products off and bul to Amazon that process can be a little bit confusing for beginners but there is going to be a full shipping tutorial in the free course which you can check out later so now you guys know some of the basics to get started selling on Amazon
but I'm sure some of you guys are wondering how much money does it actually cost so I'm going to give you guys a full breakdown right here of everything you need to know in terms of cost the checklist and everything to get started as quick as possible number one you're going to need a professional Amazon seller account I'm going to show you guys how to open that that costs $40 a month and it is a recurring cost that's insanely cheap to get access to sell approximately hundreds of millions
of consumers right here so you don't need an NSC to do that I'm going to show you guys a full walkthrough of getting going with that but don't overthink that guys getting an Amazon Seller account's nice and easy it's super affordable as well you want to make sure you have a professional seller account the second expense is going to be seller an product research software which is actually our product research tool that is going to be $20 per month about there's a more expensive plan if you start using it a
lot more you can get a free trial on our website sell.com I'm going to give you guys a full tutorial on all this stuff as well as we get further into the course I just want to give you an idea of how much it actually cost to start the nice thing is that you kind of just got to start with what you got I start with a lot less Capital list I'm just giving you guys a realistic breakdown of what I think it makes sense to have to get started in 2024 you're also going to want to have keepa proc research
software which basically stock charts for Amazon procs that cost $20 a month and is a recurring cost as well the nice thing is that's the only recurring software cost you need eventually there's other softwares you might use that help with convenience and saving time managing your business a little bit better however the only two things you need from the GetGo are seller amp and keep up for product research to make sure you don't make a bunch of silly mistakes buying the wrong products you're also going to want to have free
shipping supplies you get a ton of these labels completely free from the UPS website USPS also gives out a lot of boxes on their website too I'm going to show you guys how to ship prods later in the course which we'll be doing a full Supply breakdown there but these are the basics like you want to have like the free labels from UPS those are free obviously uh you can get a nice fancy label printer depending on your Capital availability I started out just going to my College library and such USPS gives
out a bunch of free boxes as well and then you can get the rest in terms of like 30 up label paper which is the little barcodes you're going to put on this specific product or fnc labels from Amazon if you do want to get a fancy label printer like the Rollo or palona which is another really good one I wouldn't recommend getting a fancy label printer unless you're really serious and have a lot of capital from day one your shipping Supply should be like 50 bucks Max to get started you also want to get
all the free cashback and coupon Chrome extensions I'm going to show you guys how to use those later in the video during the product research section you are going to want to have rettin top cashback Be Frugal Retail Me Not coupon birds and Capital One shopping in terms of free cash back and coupon extensions that make product research a lot easier no cost for those you do want to have them know they'll make your life a lot easier and then the biggest expense for beginners and probably the most thing
that people are confused about is is how much money do you need for products I'd recommend somewhere between 1 and 3K to get started in terms of inventory budget however like I said I got started with a lot less than that just a couple hundred bucks but I didn't know you could sell name brand prodcts when I was new to get started selling name brand prods which in my opinion is the best side also of 2024 and it's definitely the best way to get started selling on Amazon in 2024 and you're going to need between one and
3K to get going with that say you only have a couple hundred bucks it probably makes sense to start out selling used products on Amazon from thrift stores Used Books used electronics and everything like that so somewhere between 1 and 3K for inventory puts the total starting budget somewhere around like 2 to 3K ideally got to have keepa got to have seller you need to get that Amazon seller account set up as soon as possible and then you just Dive Right into starting with prodct research a lot of beginners make a big fuss about
shipping supplies and stuff like that if you had a bunch of orders to fulfill or you had a bunch of prox to ship out to Amazon you would figure it out and just go to Walmart that same day don't sweat it over that stuff getting going is really nice nice and simple just use this blueprint and let's keep it moving with the free course guys so now that you guys know how much Capital it takes to get started and that full breakdown I want to talk a little bit more conceptual in terms of five things I wish I knew when I got started
selling on Amazon so that you can save a ton of time and avoid the same mistakes I made and can make progress quicker the first one like I talked about a little bit earlier is just choosing the right business model a lot of beginners make it way too complicated on themselves trying to do wholesale or private label that are way more timec consuming expensive and risky for beginners I'm a huge fan of the Arbitrage model specifically online Arbitrage buying from Big sites that we know are selling legit products selling bigname brands
customers already know like and Trust they're already searching for with proven sales history I'm going to show you guys how to find all of those products and overall I just see the mistake so many times of sellers trying to get started with stuff that's way above their skill level way above what amount of capit they have online Arbitrage is the easiest way to get started and it takes less capital and it tends to be a lot less risky than wholesale or priv label and that's why I'm such a big fan of the model and I'm
going to show you guys in the free course everything you need to know to get started making money as quick as possible you guys will hear me talk about this at the end of the course as well but networking and getting in the Amazon community is a massive benefit as well we'll pop some pictures up on the screen right here I've made some amazing friends lifelong friends through selling on Amazon that I've just met on social media and some of them I've only met in person a couple times being connected
and having friends that are in the space makes the process a hell of a lot more fun I have a free Discord Community I'm going to put at the link in the description where you can meet Network and build with 50,000 other Amazon sellers it's completely free and just being active in the Amazon community and on social media documenting my journey from the ground up attracted a lot of other Amazon Sal into my life and that's provided tons of opportunity if I had put more effort into that I'd be way
more connected I'd probably have a lot more opportunity I know about more stuff especially now I was newer and it overall would have helped me avoid a lot of mistakes and move a lot quicker I am super thankful that I did put a lot of time into networking and putting myself out there and I think that's a massive mistake a lot of beginners make is they don't do that and that leads them to having to do everything on their own having to make all the mistakes on their own having to find all the opportunity
onone and the nice thing is getting the community is completely free and I'm going to talk about that a little bit later in the course as well number five is scaling the scalable when I got started people told me that fbm didn't work people told me that Retail Arbitrage wasn't worth their time I broke all the rules and made over $100,000 in my first 10 months a lot of which was merch and fulfilling products as well as a ton of Retail Arbitrage and pickup orders on top my normal online Arbitrage doing Retail Arbitrage leads
to a lot less competition and tends to have higher profit margins and doing Merchant filled helps you sell products a lot quicker and avoid lots of competition so you can make money quick ER and learn quicker so don't worry about what the herd's doing play your game and build your own skill over time in this free course I'm here to show you what's worked for me and other sellers I've helped get going you're going to build out your own methods strategies Etc but it's important as a beginner to
really really take action be consistent and work hard and that takes me to my next point which is the importance of a long-term mindset making money online is a world of shortterm thinkers people trying to maximize one business model then get into the next one when it doesn't work people bus business model hopping like crazy trying a new thing every 6 weeks and then wondering why it's not working and blaming the business model or the people they teach from a big thing I've noticed through my years in the Amazon space is the people
that stick around tend to be the people that get results you have to give yourself some time to actually learn and build the skill and see some Cycles go by some different seasons go by to actually get good at the process it's literally just a game of attrition and outlasting your competition and if you expect things to work really quick you're probably going to end up unfortunately working job for 40 years but if you commit to doing this for 6 to 12 months or a couple years it's pretty realistic that you could end up pretty
good if you work really hard and I'm here in this free course to set you up for as much success as possible and give you the entire blueprint and the next one is going to be the power of Delegation and virtual assistance this is a little bit more advanced stuff that we're going to talk about later in the course but Outsourcing shipping your products to Amazon using a prep Center saves you ton of time and Outsourcing your product research to people in the Philippines or India or some of these way cheaper countries for $3 to $6 an
hour can make your Amazon business run really efficient and run without you and I had no idea how any of that stuff worked when I got started if I had known that's what I should have been working towards so I could get to that point where I can film this video in Miami with my prep centers in Delaware and Pennsylvania pumping out products for me and my virtual assistant's helping me run my businesses a lot easier and the last thing is the power of an edge you'll see when I talk about product research that the number one mistake
beginners make is expecting items to be profitable at the adverti price and if the the idea that you don't really find items good you make them good and I'm going to show you that during the product research methods but I just want to plant that into your head that product research is by far the differentiating factor in terms of excess of Amazon SS and that needs to be where your focus is anyone can look and analyze a product but not everyone knows the best restocks or the best deals or the best sales that are going on at a
certain time and that needs to be where your focus is so those are five things I wish I knew before starting now let's jump back to more tactical content how you open an Amazon seller account so now that you guys know how much money it takes to get started and what I wish I knew when I got started now we're going to talk about how to actually create your Amazon seller account all you need to do is go to sell. amazon.
com and then just go ahead and click sign up right here and then just some stuff to know about actually creating your Amazon seller account there's a professional plan which is $40 a month and an individual plan which is $0 plus $1 per sale however if you're watching this fre course you need to be planning on selling a lot more than 40 products a month and the individual account is missing a ton of features as well in my opinion just do the professional account from day one however if you're really hurting on Capital you should probably
start out selling used books and with the individual account in LLC and business bank account is not required to get started and you can totally change to one later down the line a major Pro tip is if you're ever changing sensitive info in terms like your address your LLC your business bank account Etc give Amazon a call prior and just let them know you're making a change on your account that way it doesn't trigger any security warnings or anything like that seller central. amazon.com in the Amazon
seller app on your phone which is where your beautiful orange bars of sales data is is where you'll manage your Amazon business off of it's really simple once you get your Amazon account open just click around and you'll figure out everything you need to know however it is going to take a couple days to verify your account Amazon might send a letter to your house to verify the address or make you get on a quick interview to just verify who you are it can take a couple days to verify so it's important
that you get started with this say app don't sweat the small stuff guys Amazon Seller Central the Amazon seller app it's not complicated you'll only have to learn it once as well as getting on gated to sell big Brands and categories which is what we're going to talk about right now next section of the free course we're going to jump into is how to get ungated to sell big Brands and categories on Amazon in 2024 basically Amazon wants to avoid people selling fake products on their platform especially for brands that there's tons
of fakes in like Lego different toy brands a lot of makeup brands and Puma Adidas Under Armour Etc however the key is guys ungating used to be a really really difficult thing to do for beginners and then with what happened in 2020 and 2021 Amazon made it accessible even for complete beginners from day one and a lot of small Brands stick around for a couple minutes and I'm going to give you guys a gigantic list of those Auto on gate Brands as well in order to get approval Amazon requires either an invoice or a letter of authorization
from the brand luckily in 24 that can just be an email receipt from a big site Amazon understands that Costco and Walmart and all these gigantic retailers we know like and Trust they're letting Arbitrage sellers get approved using those pretty easily all you have to do is order 10 of a basic item that's also listed on Amazon and then submit that invoice or email download it as a PDF so once you place an order you get an email immediately you download that as a PDF just by clicking download as a PDF and
then I'd recommend saving that PDF to your computer title asore invoice unor date and then when you go to list that product on Amazon it's going to ask you to apply to sell and then it's going to ask you to submit documentation and that's going to be the documentation you submit the cool thing is just with one Adidas product from Asos or champ sports or kohs for example you can get the entire Adidas brand unlocked and that's the clutch part is that a lot of these brands that do require approval once you
do get approval which you can get as a complete beginner you can now sell tens of thousands of different fast- selling products on Amazon there's probably some people complaining in the comments about this but don't worry I'm going to show you guys everything you need to know to get it it's really important to understand guys it's completely normal to get declined several times I got declined seven times for Converse it may even happen more all you have to do is either open a new case or reapply
there's no difference with the same info and after a couple submissions they might even tell you do not apply again however it's do not apply in with the same info luckily you can really easily add more info into that same PDF using a PDF combiner from Google they're completely free like the shipping email delivery email pictures of the products once it arrives the credit card statement showing the transaction of you buying them etc for some reason a lot of people think you need to wait for the product to get to you just go ahead and
get started submitting the emails today guys it's nice and easy I am going to promise you you'll probably get declined a few times it's an automated system don't worry about it like I said a couple my on Gates got declined a bunch of times just keep keep calm keep steuding keep submitting the methods have been the same for a while they're probably not going to change for a while you just have to understand Amazon's probably going to a decline you a couple times don't worry about what they say in
the decline emails and just keep submitting and it's nice and easy I have zero incentive to tell you to do the wrong method I have all the incentive in the world to tell you to do the right method so please just trust me keep submitting they're going to have prev youw in terms of some different sites I like to use for ungating 101 champs for all the big shoe brands Walgreens for vitamin and over-the-counter medicines Walmart obviously for any Walmart private label like great value or equate Etc cuz that's the only place those
products come from if it's ever a small brand you know for a fact the brand website's going to work a lot of beauty stuff is like that where the beauty category is actually an auto ungate for most people but a lot of Brands will be gated therefore to ungate them you just order 10 or something cheap from the brand website which is typically where the profitable inventory comes from in the first place coals and E distribution are really good for the toy category as as well as any toy brands Target's
obviously going to be the place to go for any Target private label brand as well as the grocery categories really easy to do from Target as well and then certain stuff will overlap certain brands and categories like for example the toy category and then the LEGO brand and the Disney brand can tyly get done by like a Lego Star Wars item which if you just go ahead and try to list a Lego Star Wars asent and you see it gives you the option to do it for all three then you're just going to apply individually for all three of them just boom once for
Lego once for Disney once for toys all with the same documentation in three separate applications once again you're probably going to get declined a couple times it's completely normal it's part of the game so say you want to do Adidas for example all you got to do is go on a big retailer like Kohl's or Asos soccer.
com is really good as well in 2024 and just look up like a cheap product like Adidas socks for example right here like yeah like these Adidas socks then all we need to do is go over on Amazon and search Adidas socks for example here right and then you just have to find something that also matches here and you're going to take a small loss or break even on a product like this or or you can just wait till you find something profitable most advanced sellers never Place separate ungating orders cuz they understand all big retail websites work in 2024 so they
just wait if they're going to ungate something they just wait till they find something profitable and then order 10 of them to themselves submit that order confirmation off to Amazon and get that approval for all the products in that brand so if you want to do Adidas all you have to do is go to Asos look up find a cheap product that's also listed on Amazon go ahead and buy 10 download that order confirmation email and submit it off to Amazon I'd recommend doing a couple big brands from the GetGo you
guys are going to see some of my favorite ones during the product research section it's really important that you guys don't overthink ungating many small Brands as well as categories are actually Auto unated which means you don't need invoices to sell them you can sell it from day one if you hit request approval and it says you're automatically approved that's an auto on gate sound awesome I have a free gift for you I put together a gigantic list of brands that I see other resellers selling and a lot of these products are
actually Auto andate products so I'm going to leave the link down below you can download this big list and get started getting Auto unated in a lot of Brands completely from day one I think there's like 1,800 different brands on here a lot of people will go in and do a lot of these day one and get like 100 plus Brands unlocked day one however you definitely don't need to go through the entire list cuz a lot of these if you ever found them profitable you would just get Auto unated then I just like
the auto unate list and think everyone should go through it as a complete beginner just to start getting some proof of concept because you can see there's probably some people in the comments saying they can't get ungated that it's completely impossible when they didn't just submit enough and listen to the actual tutorial so make sure you go through the auto onate list it's important to not guys not every single one will work some will the more you sell the more items become Auto One Gates as well there's no specific
formula to it though you don't have to have anything Auto unated to get some of those big Brands approved however it doesn't hurt to a few quick easy wins bomba socks the colourpop be brand and one from Walmart Athletic Works from Walmart a lot of those tend to be easy aut one Gates just look up an asent on Amazon on the search bar go ahead and pull the as in from seller amp or from the URL plug that in on Amazon Seller essential in inventory ad product hit request approval and some of this stuff is going to Auto approve for you also
important to note guys you aren't required to sell an item if you ungate it eventually you'll just trust ungating and whenever you find an item profile you'll just get ungated using that email PDF however I like to recommend some of these big ones like Frontier Co-op e distribution champ soccer.
com ASO most Target Etc just cuz they have the highest hit rate in terms of getting approval fast cuz like I said it is completely normal to have to reapply for approval several times it's just an automated system looking at your documents if you're ever really nervous about this you can give Amazon a call or hit up Amazon sell help on Twitter or just in your response to the young Gates anal include like a ton of really good info in terms of your purchase be nice and professional put stuff in the notes as well so it can trigger a real human
looking at it as well if you're ever getting automatic denials which might happen too just based on the autom system you can try a different as or hit me up on Discord and I'll send you an autod Deni guide it's just really important to note it's a completely random game with th gating you're going to have to submit once for some Brands you're going to have to submit a ton of times for other brands and it's just how it works and it's not a prom it is a roadblock some people quit at and that
means more for you once you get over it inevitably that's how to get ungated in big Brands and categories and Auto unated in small Brands make sure you go through the auto onate list that's Linked In the description in terms of product analysis like I've mentioned you're going to need seller amp and keepa this is going to be the full seller amp tutorial so to start off what does the seller amp plans and pricing look like so we can see here on our website seller amp.
com build monthly for getting started which is the basic plan it's going to be $20 a month and $28 a month for getting series and if you want to do the annual plans which it can definitely make sense to if you're very serious about getting going with this business it's going to be $16 a month or $23 a month the main difference between plans is the 1,000 lookups a month versus unlimited lookups a month as well as the phone app installs and Chrome extension installs going from two up to five this is just a monthly cost
there's a twoe free trial you can get on the website seller amp.com now in terms of getting your seller amp settings set up correctly so seller amp is how you're going to be calculating the exact profit seller is going to be what you use to find products to sell as well as qualify if items to sell are good so you want to go to seller amp.
com and hit the top right and hit settings right when you get a subscription and now we want to make sure your settings are correct the main ones is going to be your buying criteria in terms of sales rank so minimum BSR I'd recommend putting 0% maximum BSR I'd recommend putting 1% for most categories you want to stay below 1% minimum profit I like $3 a unit occasionally you'll go below that depending on the volume and how cheap the product is there's going to be certain types like wholesale or like grocery pet supply products that are
really really cheap that you could go lower if the ROI is really high and minimum Roi I'd recommend 30% you do want to do higher for shoes and you can do a little bit lower for beauty and grocery types of products your prep fee for most of you guys as beginners is going to be zero your Mis fee for most of you guys as beginners is going to be zero if you were to use a prep Center in the future for example you would probably use one in a sales tax restate and and put zero for the Mixed fee percent and then put a hard prep cost of
like $150 a unit or however much that costs there's going to be a full Tour on getting set up with the prep Center later in the course as well here but for most of you guys it's going to be zero for prep fee zero for Mis fee and then for the Mis fee percent you're going to put your sales tax rate when you buy proxy sale shipping yourself to get listed on Amazon in Most states there is going to be a sales tax rate if you live in Oregon Montana Delaware or New Hampshire you have no sales talks on anything congrats Arbitrage is a little
bit easier for you and if you live in Minnesota Rhode Island New Jersey Pennsylvania some of these other states have certain categories that have no tax so on and so forth right and then for inbound shippment costs it would be really annoying and people in the comments always talk about when I show the seller an profit calculator oh what about shipping it's already factored in I'd recommend putting 60 cents per pound in the inbound shipping and doing the fees as Amazon optimized splits some other stuff those are the main settings
you need to take a look at in terms of putting your specific sales tax for the free course I'm going to put in 5% sales tax for all my calculations and 60 cents per pound personally living in Pennsylvania I have 0% sales tax on a lot of stuff and then living in Florida I have higher sales tax Ta on certain things every state differ you can find that information on Google those are going to be the main settings you want to do in seller then you want to go over to the Google Chrome Store and actually download the Sellar amp Chrome extension
that's going to be the bulk of what you'll be using seller amp for however there is a web app and a mobile app for Retail Arbitrage that I'm going to show you how to use later in the course when we do the Retail Arbitrage section the primary function of sell amp is to answer three questions for you does it sell is it profitable and can you sell it right so if we take a look up here just right off the bat you can customize there's big arguments online about where seller amp belongs on your screen here
too I'm personally I like having it on the right here right so we can immediately see the title of the product here then the Asin as well as the UPC here we can then see the weight it's really important that you know that's how you see the dimensions of the product we can see the description not super important if you want to open up the amazon product page we're already on that so we don't need to worry about that say if you want to look up this prodct and see if it's profitable you
just hit the Google button right here that's what we do for storefront stocking that's really really helpful here and then we can also see the check alerts uh don't need to worry about that we can also see that this listing has variations there's a variety of different alerts that could pop up here in terms of like suspected IP complaint issues or known IP complaint issues multible products so on and so forth here something like this we can just see that this has variations a pro tip is that that means that this listing the
11k BSR we see here isn't just for this specific variation it's for the entire listing we're going to need to look at the specific keep a chart for variations to gauge velocity not just the sales rank and estimated sales that's a question I get all the time is is the estimated sales for one variation or split between them all we can see estimated sales are shared across all variations now the profit calculator right here this is going to where you're going to spend the vast majority of your
time in selling we can see the Max cost on this item is 49 so if we plug in 49 we make about a 30% Roi after shipping fees product cost sales tax everything right factors all that stuff in the offer summary right here shows you how many people are selling this product I get the question all the time how many sellers is too many sellers on a product you guys will see as we dig further into the product research sections how I think about that stuff but typically the competition is only too much if it's making the price go down basic supply
and demand if the competition's stable and the price is stable it's probably a good product right ranks and prices right here I don't look at this tab too much but it does go over what percentage of BSR relative to the category this product is the buy box price if Amazon's in stock we can see this item Amazon isn't in stock Pro tip don't automatically be afraid of listings Amazon's on there are going to be some cases where you do want to compete with them we see a lowest FBA seller price
lowest fbm seller cost it's rare that FBA sellers would be cheaper than fbm sellers here keep up BSR drops don't really worry about that in my opinion net buy box price changes that's helpful to make sure that the price is moving so we can see that sales are actually happening here time to sale that's based on your buy cost here and then you can also refresh this data if you want to as well I like the idea of connecting your Amazon seller account for this video obviously don't have it connected here
but you can see if Amazon's tring the buy box right we can see Amazon's never on listing private label Nike is not a known private label brand it's really important if you see the private label alert on sellam don't automatically avoid that that's a massive mistake beginners make if you see that private label alert on sellam it typically just means that that listing is very low competition you need to identify if the only seller on that listing is the specific brand basically looking at the
seller's name comparing it to the brand up here and seeing if that's the case or not that is the case probably something you want to avoid if that's not the case and there is good movement and such like you're going to see how we're going to read on keepa then that is something you might want to pursue standard size pretty straightforward IP analysis if you see the IP suspected you need to look at the Cuba chart and identify if there's any cliffs in the off count which you'll see take a look at when we
look at keepo as well this listing has variations completely normal there too now you can see a mini Kea chart here within sell as well in terms of breaking down like offer count oscillation and price action and such we're going to do a I would recommend having the keepa extension as well so I don't spend much time looking at the keepa chart on here however when you are in store scanning for Retail Arbitrage it does make sense to use the keer chart on Sellar when you scan the product you can scroll down and
see the performance of the specific Kea chart however on not looking at the keepa chart when selling I'm that much when I'm doing all inrage but it is cool to get a quick view and see how stuff's actually performing here in my opinion you do want to have both I can see the offer counts nicely going up and down here so I know that this product does sell though and Common Sense this is a low ranked product it's a common color it makes sense this thing would sell particularly well and we can see that
based on the chart really nice down here taking a look at the profit calculator we see a full breakdown of the profit Roi that's going to update as you put different bu cost in say you found this for $39 here that would be 16 bucks profit 43% Roy your maximum cost to be profile at a $79 sale price would be$ 4278 and then we can see a total breakdown of the fees profit margin and the quantity Vibe I like this too if you put in 10 here we can see the amount of total products we would make based on what bulk amount we purchased that a
really important thing to note here too guys we can toggle this over to fbm so if we wanted to sell this item fbm a huge mistake beginners make is try to run the numbers on fbm just based on the numbers they see on the calculator not toggling over to fbm because if you run these numbers then you're factoring in paying the FBA fees and the fbm shipping cost however if we toggle over to fbm that takes out the FBA fees and now we just need to put in the fbm cost which is the fbm shipping cost which we're
going to show a full breakdown of how that goes based on the weight later in the course something like this that weighs over one pound is probably going to ship for like 10 bucks so you can see FBA and fbm and end up being pretty similar cost for the most part in most cases taking a look down here we have the variations feature which is in beta I don't really use that particularly too much if you want to factor in some different discounts you can totally do that as well personally I like to do the math within seller amp and say I have
10% off I'll just go ahead here and multiply by 0.9 you can do division here for bundles for multipacks multiplication it's pretty neat you can do the whole calculator subtractions for different coupons boom in there as well really helpful to know how to use that as well as basic Google Sheets functions to to be a good Amazon Seller now we can see this is where we'll use the storefront stocking feature which is going to be the main product research method you're going to use if you're a complete beginner we can see the offers
tab right here which shows the stock counts as well as the price action profit and Roi based on our buy cost that different sellers are at we can also load more and see down here as well as the Fulfillment types in terms of finding good storefront stock as a beginner just open up everyone here and then now we can use seller amp and use the storefront stocking feature to look inside these seller storefronts and see all the different products they carry as well as all their different brands right all their different categories here
right and then we can scroll through these different Sellers and see all the different items they carry here so like boom we can see lusr low BSR we can see the Max cost we'll need to pay the offers so the competition the buy box price how much this seller has in stock as well as if you want to open up more storefronts here we can click these and a quick view of the keid chart as well so sront stocking is a really powerful product research method that I'm going to show you guys after we learn how to
use keepa and take a look at a couple winning product examples that is going to be the main product resarch method I recommend for beginners and it's going to be storefront stocking using seller app that's the main function the offers tab is figuring out what sellers have a lot of reviews that are selling this listing people we can go ahead and see okay what else are they selling that we can go ahead and take a look at and try to track down their best products at profitable prices you guys are going to
see me do that a ton in a little bit and track down a bunch of winners here the next feature of seller amp I use this a ton is the Google Sheets feature to stay organized say for example we found these Nike shoes good but they were out of stock that's still something I want to track over time if I'm putting in all this work into product research I want to make sure that I'm maximizing and even if I can't buy something today I can buy it in the future most likely if it restocks and I want to have that
catalog all I need to do is click this out of stock button right here and this automatically oneclick exports out to seller amp Google Sheets right here then I can say like out of stock on 5 10 24 check for restocks weekly and so that's really really helpful there's going to be a full guide on how I use that later but that oneclick export feature in seller is really helpful for keeping your leads organized there's also just the history in terms of when you've actually looked at this product we see
I've refreshed this a few times so you can get for different examples throughout the course as well as the buybox analysis is really helpful for knowing who's getting the the buy box at what price how often so we can see all the different sellers that are getting buy box on this specific product right here we can also filter to see who's won it the most we see so this seller has gotten 35% of the buybox share at what average price it's really important to note that people get buy box on on different prices even inad day just
based on where you're priced and a lot of sellers are selling stuff too cheap so when you're initially sending products into Amazon for the most part worry about matching buy box for fbn and price of a little bit above for FBA cuz often times Amazon will give the buy box at higher prices to FBA SS and you don't know unless you test so the buy box Doats specifically right here are really helpful for knowing who's sold in terms of at the most expensive prices you can click here to see who's won at the most
then you can also click here and see who's won it most frequently here right you can see literally different sellers getting the buy box intraday as well as their fulfillment type to gauge whether or not you'll be able to FM a product that the big way to tell if you can merch and fulfill something is looking if other sellers are merch filling that product which we can see in this case no fbm sellers have gotten sales for two weeks here we can see that's probably something I would want to avoid fbm in
and would probably have to FBA so like I said the Chrome extension is the main component of seller amp you're going to be using for online Arbitrage you'll use the mobile app which is included in your subscription for Retail Arbitrage which is really helpful you can just get on the phone scan products in store and then on top of also what we took a look at with the profit calculator storefront stocking Google Sheets you want to make sure you have a good grip on all that there's also the web app which if we
click open right here we can now see all the data nicely laid out in one place specifically for wholesale orders or potentially bigger purchases it's a really good idea to open up the web app and now you can see a really nice holistic view of the profit calculator as well as the keepa charts right here to see how well a listing sells if the offer count is not really changing you know this listing doesn't really sell too much if it's going nice and up and down like this we know this listing is selling pretty nice we can also see the
other sell and open them up to storefront stock plug in any discounts we want to potentially use you guys see how that nicely discounted right there we can see seller cenal if we want to add product we can go to the alerts Tab and check if we're on gated as well that's a huge thing to do as a beginner is just go to your local Walmart and scan a bunch of stuff with cell and just check if you're eligible right there which is really helpful too like I said though you're mainly going to be using
the Chrome extension specifically for online Arbitrage the core of that's going to be sront stalking which we'll show you how to do live in a little bit as well as taking a look at the profit calculator right here as well so that was how to use sell which is what I'm using to calculate the exact net profit now we're going to talk about how to use keepa which is the auto product research tool I use every single day in my own Amazon business if you guys have any questions about this as you're going
through the course make sure to let me know Down Below in the comments I'd love to answer your questions let's jump in the keep tutorial so now that you guys know how to use seller amp we also need to know how to use keepa before getting into doing live product research and showing you guys how you can get started finding profitable online Arbitrage products this week so if we take a look here we know the seller amp data profit calculator buy box everything like that but now if we scroll down here we can
see the keepa chart which basically shows us how a procs been performing over time now when you open up keepa you're going to see three different charts personally I would recommend clicking this sub ranks button right here so you only see two of them if you accidentally are missing this bottom chart it's probably because you accidentally click less historical data right here so I'd recommend clicking more historical data if you ever missed that boxon that you see the top two charts right here the top chart and the
bottom chart the middle one sub ranks you can get that out of there right here now cool thing about keepa is it tracks product performance ever since a product was added on Amazon so we can see this specific item was 401 days ago so now we can see the market on this product ever since it was added on Amazon if you're taking notes you want to write down bottom chart shows offer count which is the a competition on a product I'm also going to show you guys how much competition is too much competition on a
specific product and the top chart shows the demand over time right so for example if we unclick all this stuff right here right we see we click sales rank right here I I see people make the mistake all the time not having the right stuff clicked up here as well so if we plug in sales rank now we can see the sales rank over time and see you know how fast this product's been selling since it was added if you're a beginner you primarily want to be looking at the 3month data right so we can see if 3 Monon here right then we
click the buy box now we can see what the buy box has been you guys can see the competition here nicely went down from like 51 sells on April 1st down to like a low point of like 11 in late April right to right around like 26 now and the buy box price went from like 31 up to like 38 it's really important when you're reading keepa charts you can see like the buy box price can literally change intraday and such as well here too and then the third party FBA here I like having that click too so I can see
the lowest third FBA price it's really important to note that the buy box can be way higher than the lowest price based on low price sellers having their inventory backordered at Amazon basically they ship the product off to Amazon they undercut the price but Amazon's displaying them on the listing but they're still showing a really far out delivery date because their product isn't ready at Amazon so that's a really good Pro tip that I'm going to reiterate several times here is that if you're
sending procs off to Amazon it's decent practice to price it above the buy box to make sure you're not in up because you can see all the time you're going to see examples of products where the buy box is substantially above the lowest and it's just due to backordered inventory right so we can see all the competition and price action here the thirdparty triangles here the orange triangles those indicate the lowest third party seller if you're seeing the blue squares here I personally wouldn't
recommend having that in that's the lowest third party fbm don't think that's that important data and then you automatically have the new price in there too and such here but big ones is going to be making sure that the sales rank has consistently been under 100 or under 150,000 year and then making sure that the offer Count's actually moving specifically right here as well and making sure that the trend is good we can see in this case the trend of this item is offer count going down price nicely going up so this is the type of
stuff we want to take a look at another thing you guys are going to see as we do a lot of live sourcing here is going to be setting keepa alerts which is basically you can set price criteria so like for example say you could pay 22 for this product and it's not quite profitable at 38 but it is profitable if it becomes 45 you could add in a little alert here and put like 45 and then hit start tracking and keep would actually send you an email if that product hit profitable territory you combine that with the seller amp Google Sheets like
we talked about it's a recipe to find a ton of profitable leads a ton of people are sleeping on the keepa tracking feature it's so nice to get those emails when items you already took the time to find become profitable right so we can see that's the big thing take a look primarily at the three-month data if it's a more seasonal product definitely take a look you know at the year-long data or the past couple years because the sales rate is going to go up and down during different periods the price
action is you know if the price is headed down it's probably because the competition's headed up you want to avoid listings that look like that I'm going to show you guys a ton of examples of winning procs we're going to live Source winning procs as well and then we're also going to show you examples of the types procs you don't want to source as well here so price history that's pretty much it you want to make sure that buy box price is stable or going up and the competition is stable or going
down it's only too much competition if the price is going down and that we know for a fact if the price is stable or going up and we can see movement in the offer count here that there's a good chance people are making money right now if you want to see the averages on a product over time hit data and then we can see product details here guys so now we can see bunch of useless information right here I wouldn't really worry about but you can also see these sales rank averages over here by hitting data and
then product details so we can see this product has a 90day average of a 31k sales rank which is really good sales rank drops wouldn't really worry about that but the more the merrier right we can see the average buy box price as well as well as the average lowest price third party FBA Etc the primary ones you want to look at is making sure that the sales rank's been good over time right as well as taking a look at the buy box price over time and then the review count going up is very helpful too cuz
we know that that uh that ADM sales here w't really worry too much about uh stuff down here for example like sure you could look at the average offer count but if the offer count was bad the price would be heading down right so it doesn't really matter right there uh the offers tab right here not a huge fan of the offers tab specifically because it can be very inaccurate data right here so a lot of people swear by this data if you go look at something you've actually sold a bunch of there's a very good
chance it's inaccurate I wouldn't really worry about that where you're going to gauge if a listing is selling is looking if the offer count is going up and down I do like the offers tab however for going over here and seeing when sellers were first seen on a listing so like if someone was first seen on something 6 months ago they're probably making money on if they're still on it right and in many cases it'll be offer counts gone up and down people are restocking it as well which is a good sign too that those
of the people want to compete with that have been for around for a while it's also a really good place to find people to store from on stock too and such as well and then if you want to take a look at deciding where you're going to price a product the data buy box statistics is really helpful too and that now we can see over the 30-day period boom over the 90day period boom over the 180-day period boom over the 365 day period who's won the buy box how much so we can filter here to see who's won it the most
so this seller's gotten the most buy Box share we can see who sold at the most expensive price we can see who's won it most frequently so you guys can see literally just in the past yeah 11 minutes four different people have gotten the buy box and in the past day like eight different people have gotten the buy box here right wouldn't really worry about the new off count or the stock count as well we can also see if fbm stars are getting on a listing here we see this listing is very fbm friendly because there's a ton of people that are
not FBA that don't have that FBA check mark they're making money let's see if it's recently been fbm friendly H 30-day we can see yeah look at that literally earlier today one hour ago fbm seller in the buy box seven minutes ago fbm sell in the buy box right if we see here yeah it's been okay so yeah you can see literally in the past 12 minutes four different people have had the buy box it it is important to note that buybox share is geographically based in respect to where your listing is compared to the
customer that's looking at it so me in Florida if I'm looking at a listing from a seller shopping to ship it to me in Florida I'm going to see a different seller than a customer that looks at it in California and that's why the nice thing is once you send more and more listings in Amazon you build trusts in the buy box the cool thing is we can see these are sellers with yeah nine reviews here right like people are getting you know sales inant like this seller has one reviews and he's still getting buy
box right like view count really doesn't matter in respect to getting sales it's just being priced competitively and having your inventory checked in that makes the biggest difference with that so buy box sets is really helpful for figuring out where you want to price a product too because we can see in this case there's people literally in the same day getting buy Box share at 33 but also getting buy Box share at 38 so there's a ton of examples of stuff like that that's really helpful so the main
place you're going to be hanging out is the price history track product and data within Kaa as well there's also Kaa proog finder which is pretty helpful for sourcing as well too now I know some of you guys are thinking should I compete with Amazon on certain listings and the key is that if Amazon's on a product you're looking to sell they're going to share the buy box sometimes and they're not going to share the buy box other times if we take a look at this specific product right here we can go down and
see Amazon's on this thing however if we take a look at the keep chart we can see there's still nice third-party seller oscillation here on the bottom keep chart showing the competition now we're going to hit data and then buy box statistics here and see if Amazon's actually sharing the buybox and that we can see over the past 30 days Amazon's got about 58% of the buybox share I'd be comfortable hopping on some like that as long as I can nicely see that people are selling out here right so to answer the
question of should you compete with Amazon it's if they're sharing the buy box sometimes they will be sometimes they won't be and the data buy box statistics and thirdparty offer count is going to give you a great indication of if that's moving like we can see buy box price was 54 Amazon price was 70 Amazon ain't getting no buy box on that but then we can see intraday here right sometimes Amazon's getting it other times they're not right so this would be something I would be comfortable hopping
on and that data buybox statistics data is coming really in handy in terms of taking a look at that I also want to show you guys just how much the market can change over time this pool right here if we take a look it's currently buy boxing at 88 if we look back a couple years ago here we can see look at how during what happened in 20120 and 2021 this was literally selling for $285 in 2020 and then it was consistently selling for like 170 right in 2021 like that's how different like stuff can be over time
and if you take a look at a listing like this and purely look at the sales rank we and see see how every every summer the sales rank plummets because this is obviously getting in a lot higher Demand right here as well so we can see it's very interesting how seasonal demand can work on certain things and it's really important to you know if it's right now you're looking at soccer products don't look at how it did you know the last 30 days look at how it did last July in last August and that's going to take
looking historically on keepa and you also do want to look at how it's done recently too as well because you don't want to speculate I really recommend only buying stuff that's profitable today some people do Buy and Hold however I'm personally a fan of just quick flips it is interesting seeing how the market can change on certain prodcts throughout just stuff going on in the world as well as just seasonal in general that it makes perfect sense like the sales rank on a pool goes way up aka the demand goes way down because the
lower the sales rank the better in the winter when people aren't buying pools this month majorly important piece of information here when you see a listing like a shoe to finish up the keep tutorial we can see this has an 11k rank so does that mean that's an 11k rank for this specific variation no the sales rank is going to be for the entire listing so all variations and colors combined but how do you tell the specific performance of a specific variation and that's going to be using the specific keeper chart for that
variation for example we see this is the keepo chart for a size 13 if we change this to a size eight for example right we can see byb on this is 99 refresh this the cuyo chart's going to look different here so the main driver of figuring out which variation sells best right and would see this doesn't even have a buy box or it didn't a lot till recently don't necessarily be afraid of stuff that doesn't have a buy box there's still a lot of money in it right we see this specific keepa chart is for
this specific variation so that's how you're going to tell the performance of a specific variation is going to be taking a look at that specific Kea chart as well as the variations tab on keepa that if we hit here one of the most important parts of the entire setup process I'd highly recommend pausing this video once you get keepa coming in here and organizing your variations column similar to the way I have it basically you can drag these different columns around pretty much and such so how do you tell in here which variation
sells quickest so the easiest way is going to be by filtering here reviews to see which variation has the most reviews however that doesn't take into account how long a variation has been around my personal favorite way to see how well a variation moves is this offer count chart like you got to drag your columns around to match mine here right you might even have to go to configure columns and select different ones that you want right I'm personally a big fan of taking a look at the offer count right to see how well this moves so for
example like this one has 449 reviews it has no buy box some sellers would immediately be afraid of that because it doesn't have a buy box but we can see this listing's nicely moving like crazy like nice off account you know going up and down and such right that's a great way to tell if something's moving but if we scroll way down here there's going to be some super blocky iations like this that aren't really selling at all but then you can see this one has no reviews which some people would avoid because it
has no reviews but we can see it's only been around for a year and I can clearly see this listing sells because it had 10 sells on April 1 and it has three sellers now so the best way in my opinion to decipher which variations to buy which would obviously be ideally all of them if they were all good is going to be filtering top to bottom by buy box price and then hunting for expensive stuff that has good velocity in the offer count or filtering top to bottom by reviews and seeing the fastest selling ones and trying to find high
price action within them you can also go ahead here and filter by Lois to see stuff that doesn't have a buybox as well because there can still be a lot of profit in that and the biggest thing with variations is using Common Sense around figuring out which variation sells best just thinking like which is the most common color most common size and then you can also use the anecdotal data of the specific Keo chart for that variation and then I also highly recommend organizing your variations tab similar to M so you can go ahead and
navigate this stuff really easily that will make a big difference too being able to nicely filter click in here to filter by buy box click here to filter buy ratings click here to filter Buy the lowest to see stuff without a buy box so on and so forth and then referencing velocity in the offer count section as well so that's how to get started using keepa seller imp and keepa are the only product research tools I use in my business the nice things are also both incredibly cheap you can get a free trial of seller at seller.com you can
get a keepa subscription on the keep website as well and as we do more product research here getting into the sourcing section live sourcing you're going to see a ton more examples of what good and bad keepa charts look like as well but that's the basics you're primarily going to be looking at the three-month data you want to make sure the prices either stable are going up competition's either stable or going down make sure there's other people selling a listing right if there's variations you want to take a look at
the specific Kea charts and the review count and the offer count movement to gauge the performance of a specific variation if Amazon's on something it's it's not cut and dry I don't compete with Amazon or I do like competing with Amazon it's just is Amazon Trend the buy box on that specific listing and that's the keep chart tutorial guys if you have any questions make sure to let me know down below let's keep moving now that you guys know how to analyze prods I also want to show you
guys a bunch of winning prodct examples and then we're also going to take a look at red flags you want to avoid in certain products this specific ski right here we see buy box is currently $42 on Amazon a occasionally the buy box won't match the buy box price showing on seller amp so you want to edit this right here and then we see our Max cost is 21 right so if we take a look over here on JC Penney we can see these are going for 30 bucks and it shows 24 with code your home however I saw there was a
30% code on Capital and shopping which actually takes this from 30 take off 30% down to about 21 with six stars profits it's a 30% r y so it's getting close there to the winning product criteria however taking a look here on cardbear and looking up discounted gift cards on JC Penney we can see we can get another eight nine or even 16% off right here so say we get 10% off right there we can go ahead and take off this 10% here just multiply within sell amp right here and now this becomes a nice $9 profit after shipping sales tax fees
everything currently profitable we can see ranks a little bit High however ever taking a look at this keepa chart here guys we can see there's nice oscillation on the offer count here it's going up and down it's been profit full for a while something like this for my own personal criteria I would consider a winning product and if we take a look at it's pretty much profle ever since like September down to like 39 for a little bit here however this is a lighter product which would be good for fbm as
well and when it's above 25 bucks but well below one pound it tends to be a little bit better for fbm as well so we get some extra profit margins or when people are on a listing fbm we can price above them higher with FBA typically and scale a little bit easier this is a great example of how one of those extension coupons with capital on shopping can really really come in handy in terms of making items profitable and stacking on a gift card it's really important to know guys you can sell all different types of products on Amazon
what's less important is what product it is what's more important is the data and metrics on a certain products so you're going to have all different types of stuff in your store we see these Nike socks right here they're currently Buy boxing on Amazon at 32 that puts our Max cost at about 16 we see over on Dick Sporting Goods they're going for 16 bucks however if we scroll to the bottom of the screen here we can see we can get another 10% off just using this email coupon right here right so at 16 we're
right about at a 30% Roi however taking off 10% now this becomes a nice 46% Ry after shipping fees sales stocks and everything like that and now we know this is profitable today and we just need to inspect the keepy but and make sure it's profitable over time so in see something like this the competition's been stable for like three straight weeks here almost a month right if we take a look at the yearlong if something's out of stock that's not necessarily a green flag or a red flag you just need to look at the sales
history of when it's actually been in stock to verify if it's good and we can see this product has literally been profitable for the past year it's been listed on Amazon it was out of stock for pretty much an entire year right there so this is an example of a nice profitable product just using an evergreen coupon on Sporting Goods the next example so this is an example of a product that's profitable using a holiday sale Yankee Candle here we can see got this big sale going on for Mother's Day 15% cash back right here we
can see $7 retail it's also a best seller five for 27 right here so that means we can get this a lot cheaper right so let's go ahead here and take a look at this so 27 divided by 5 right brings us to $5.40 a unit which is only a dollar profit a piece and a 20% Roi however if we take a look at the keep on this prodct we can see we've pretty much been profitable on this forever right it's a little bit lower right now looks like one or two SS are just tanking it here however if this was something I was
looking to invest in from my own business I would definitely consider taking it considering how much higher the price action is over time it's very consistently in the 15 to 17 range if this thing gets up to you know 16 17 again it's like five bucks profit and an 86% Roi and it's such a cheap investment I would take a shot on something like this that I don't think's going to get much lower and that I can see has really been consistent over time looks like competition's just training up a tad
there's a couple newer sellers price tanking it right here as we can see s re pric er but a lot of people have hung out here and buyb boxing know at 17 and 16 and it's so important that you guys dig in specifically on keepa and look at where the buy box is actually going not just the current price there might be some kind of Rewards program or discounted gift cards we can get on Yankee Candle as well that'll make it even better this next proc is an awesome example of the type of nuance that can exist on certain items so we can see
this seller that's currently in the buy box here is an fbm seller it doesn't ship from Amazon the buy box shows us 21 but it's actually 2183 plus $6 shipping so that changes the game a lot if we open up seller amp here we can see this thing's buy boxing at 21.8 3 and we can add in six here right I recommend doing free shipping for FBA it's always going to be free shipping for fbm you are going to pay individual shipping cost but I recommend just baking it into your cost and matching the buy box on the
other sellers we're going to dig into that later in the course we only be worry about that for now but if we take a look here it's really 28 which drags our Max cost up to 1362 and I could see over on Puma we're at 14 plus 20% off and really high cash back so if we go ahead and plug in 11.
19 right here we can see that's a nice $7 profit and a 60% r y and there's really high cash back as well and now all we need to do is make sure that this item has been profit over time looking at keep up and we see competition's beautifully trending down right here price is beautifully trending up it's even spiking up a little bit more as of late what if it drops back down to 25 where it consistently was we're still fine we're still making four bucks of Pop right there and we're buying this during
a Mother's Day sale which is going to end and historically we can see this side has been nice and profit for a while guys like it was hanging out a lot yeah in February this thing was like 34 and we can see right here so if we take a look at the buy box stats on keepa here guys we can see this thing's been profitable forever if we take a look at like the 180 view on sell amp we can see nice and Powerful over time right here absolutely not a problem whatsoever there got to love that extra 20% off on Puma for mother stad so this is an
interesting item here cuz we can see this product actually doesn't have reviews however it's going for 30 bucks just taking a look at here this Under Armour t-shirt right here we can see it's a 100K rank for the entire listing it's hanging out over here on Dick Sporting Goods for only $10.
97 here the interesting thing is on this specific product here this looks like it's the same thing however if we actually look closely the color is actually different here and in the picture it's slightly different so even though at 10.97 right here right this is actually nice and profitable $940 profit and an 85% r y it's really important to verify that the colors are the same and that the pictures are the same and verify that it's the right item that's a mistake I made early on my journey was not fully verifying that it was the
exact same product and I don't want you guys to run into that so even though something looks like it's a winning product it doesn't always mean that it is and even though the keepa has been Prof on this thing sellers have sold out it's only ever been one seller we got some wi room because we got some pricing power on this thing this item is not good because it's not the right item the next item that is a winner here is these jockey tank tops we can see buy boxing at 32 900 reviews always a good sign the
more reviews it has an interest in case right here is it says only 26 estimated sales per month however if we take the look down here at the keepo we can see the sales rank was really good and then randomly skyrocketed for a little bit right here which tends to be a red flag however if we look over the long term the sales Bank was really really good for a while and it returned back down to where it was right so if we take a look on the jockey website it's 20 bucks we got a Mother's Day code for 25% off so
if we plug in 20 on seller amp here we can see we will make a 6% Roi definitely not good but if we take off that 25% now this is $6.50 profit and a 43% r y and look at how stable this keepa chart is here guys and what I love about stuff with different colors and different sizes is if we can pay 15 bucks for these tank tops across the board this other one this 2XL that's at that's at 32 isn't going to be bad either these white ones are potentially going to be good as well that's a great opportunity
as well we can see right here they got the all black ones they got all white ones as well this is actually multiple winning products within one cuz we can see nice offer count oscillation on several of these and we're only paying 15 bucks they might have some type of Rewards program or discounted gift card we can juice the Roy a little bit more love variation stuff like this where you can find multiple winners in one just using one coupon they repeat to self every holiday love to see it this is an interesting one I don't sell a lot of
pet supplies myself cuz they tend to be pretty heavy here however if we take a look these are selling absolutely Sky High as we can see they're going for 33 lowest plus $11 shipping like I said I recommend doing free shippings for fbm some people don't though right so if we take a look here we can see over on chewy with the auto ship right they're $467 a piece for a bundle of two so that means for a bundle of six we would go and type 4.
67 time 3 here right buy box right around 44 right so we can see $12 profit 87% Roi the interesting thing is on a listing like this we can see this list currently doesn't have a buy box here that scares away a lot of new sers however if we take a look at the keep chart we can see this is nicely moving for a while and there hasn't been a buy box like literally the entire last year but the offer Count's still nicely going up and down and we know that sellers are making money on this product so don't be afraid of stuff without a buy box and
don't be afraid to sell bundles of products as well you just always need to double check on your own and make sure it's the exact same product what's cool about this listing specifically was I could see there's a bunch of fbm people and FBA people on this so we would have both options here as well taking a look there too getting into some beauty action here guys we can see this eyeliner or something like that I don't know I don't really care it's it's a it's buy boxing for 18 bucks we can see
over on the colourpop website right here we got 15% cash back we can see it's going for seven bucks I saw on the homepage of the website that they had a 25% off for Mother's Day so even with no coupon this thing ain't bad it's hitting the Max cost right here so we can see right 50 % RI but if we take off 25% from that and use that coupon that I found on the homepage coupons and sales stuff like that makes the world go around in online Arbitrage and plug this in now we're making about 100% Ry and we
just need to make sure that this item's good over time take a look at the keep a chart which we can see nice and stable over time if we take a look at the year long there's some history at 15 some history at like 12 and such which we still pretty much close to good a break even at we can see for like the past seven weeks here it's been hanging out between between 14 and 17 even if goes down to 14 we're still making some good money on that 50% Roy not bad stuff like this is great Beauty types of stuff
because it's nice high volume replenishable a lot of small Beauty Brands only come from the brand website as well profitable or that's really the only places that sell it so you can really nicely dial in and figure out exactly where the stuff's coming from and then you just need to know the sales Cycles or the discounts these websites offer to find the best performing asens at that time and make some good profit this was a banger proct here I was surprised by how good this was no buy box no problem typically if Amazon takes
away the buy box they think an item selling for too much but the key is that that doesn't stop consumer selling it the only time having no bu box would be a problem is if it was making the sales rank absolutely shoot up and the price was shooting down and the competition was shooting up which shows that that item isn't selling anymore this product here we can see even though there's no buy box across the year there's beautiful up and down on the offer count so we know that people are buying this
product and then if we filter to the 3 Monon we can see the competition shooting down and the price is shooting up as well current lowest price is 24 here couple fbm SS on it which is awesome and then it goes straight up to 28 here so hopefully it keeps trending up in that direction and we see over on shopwss going for 12 bucks right here and then Capital One Shopping one of those free cash back extensions I mentioned couple ways to get about 20% off right here so we end up paying about $9.60 for this item going for 24 about
$6 profit 67% r y exact type item we want to flip from a big retail website if you're ever unsure if a specific supplier is legit it's really important that you check their Google reviews check their trust pilot check their social media look up the LLC see if they have customer service on their website or just ask in like our free Discord Community which linked down below and see if any sellers have any advice on it but you can typically find out pretty well if a suppliers legit checking trust pilot checking Google my business Google
reviews looking up their address as well as a Pro tip is for the most part check out through PayPal for added security and if any of the cash back portals like Capital One shopping reton or top cash back sh it's going to help you even more verify if it's legit I don't really think they put any not legit websites on those cashback portals because it would end up screwing the customer and make them not trust rackon their top cash back as well and number 10 another winning product right here we can see
these are currently buy boxing at 90 bucks that seems pretty expensive for the stuff right here and when see over on coals they're going for 70 right right the problem is at 70 we would lose $12 profit per sale however there's a 20% code right here which takes us from 70 if we go ahead and plug in 0.
98 here down to about 56 we're also earning K's cash on this purchase which depending on how you discount ends up being right around another 16 20% off depending on if you use a discounted gift card as well here so using a discounted gift card and earning koh's cash that we're going to average that discount in on the purchase earns us about another 20% off if I were to buy this I'd get the discounted gift card from carar or top cashback so if we plug in another 08 here you guys see how that coupon
stacking can really add up now I'm personally not familiar with this brand I did find it via the storefront stalking method so I know other resellers are making money on this product I can see there is suspected I IP issues on seller ampere however taking a look at the cupid chart right here I don't see any steep drops when you are unfamiliar with the brand like I am in this case if I were going to buy a bunch of this I would talk to some other sellers look at some keepa charts of this specific brand here and I just
wanted to include a kind of random brand example that is nice and profitable and show you that when it's something that you aren't totally sure of you need to vet if other sellers are making money on and that there's no IP complaint history on that but purely on a datab basis this is a phenomenal example of how we can use coupons and rewards programs and discounted gift cards to make items profitable without the 20% without the koh's cash without the gift card this item wasn't good but now utilizing that
stuff this stuff does become good and those are 10 winning product examples and the exact types of products I sell in my own sfigure Amazon business so we just took a look at some winning product examples now I want to show you guys a really important segment of the free course as well what bad products look like and red flags you want to avoid so we can take a look here inside my screen and now we're going to take a look at five specific red flags that you need to avoid for products you're going to start to go ahead and
Source that'll save you a ton of time money avoiding these listings cuz the last thing you want to do is buy the wrong products and after this we're also going to do some live product resarch and show you guys my two favorite sourcing strategies as well and how you can actually go ahead and start finding wi products to sell in your own Amazon business this week so taking a look here right off the bat we have these Puma sneakers right here so immediately where my eyes go is the seller amp see the sales rank right here we can see the
sales rank on this product is about 2.8 million it's in the 2% of the category we can see that's giving a a red on my sell this is something I want to avoid and the reasoning on that is like we know sales rank indicates velocity and the lower the sales rank the better and once you get above like a 150k sales rank typically the keepo chart is going to have to look really good for you to take it and it's going to have to have like history below the sales rank criteria that we want so for example if
we take a look at this keeper chart here guys we're going to be able to see it's super super blocky right here there's not too much movement not too much offer count going up and down at all the price is really blocky as well so the first red flag overall is going to be avoiding listings that sell too slow the nice thing is it's really easily to see that you can just take a look immediately at the sales rank and the keyo chart and get a good gauge that the second red flag you want to avoid and this is a big
one is going to be products with IP complaint history IP complaint stands for intellectual property complaint basically that the benefit of this business is we don't have to create our own products we don't have to build a brand anything like that we resell bigname Brands right however there's people that own these name name brands and occasionally they don't want resellers selling their products and you think they would just avoid people from getting on G in and stuff but some brands that do allow people to get
ungated have a history of kicking people off even on certain listings luckily you can see that pretty clearly in the keepa charts here so if we take a look at this product right off the bat right and sometimes they'll have a little red uh or little orange or red IP aler in selling up as well the big thing is going to be the keepa chart specify for avoiding I PE complaints guys if we take a look at the year-long view of this keepa chart the price is pretty stable here right and then the offer Count's
nicely gone up and down so we know that this product sells however we see right in mid April there's a massive cliff in the offer count which indicates basically that the brand owner kicked everyone off this listing so unfortunately this is something we want to avoid it's a major red flag if you see a big offer count Cliff like this and you want to stay away from a listing like that the nice thing is if you're sticking to the stuff we talk about you know mainly in this course we talking about selling a lot of big Brands and
stuff you're doing storefront stock which I'm going to show you how to do you're looking at what other people are selling you're mainly sticking to those items you're not going to run in this stuff super often now it's not the end of the world if you do get an IP complaint you're going to get inauthentic complaints from time to time there's another module in the course that talks about how to actually deal with that luckily we're buying products from Big legit websites so we do have
the correct documentation here however in general you want to be selling products that don't have any offer ground history Cliffs here and we like literally this had been a good reseller friendly product for a while at some point they just decided that they didn't want people selling it now we can see other people are hopping on this I think that's people that don't really know what they're doing and I would definitely recommend staying away from anything that has an offer count Cliff CU you want to avoid getting IP
complaints as much as possible the next example of red flags is price tanking and competition shooting up occasionally when there's a pretty good deal going on a bunch of sellers might hop on a listing so if we take a look at this frog sply right here we can see competition was like three in like early April and now it's like 30 and the price action in early April was like 18 and now it's down at 8 right and these Trends tend to continue so if a product's going up in price and down in competition it's probably going to
continue that way right especially if you know it's a pretty hard toin product which you're going to build tolerance for how you can identify that over time using the different discounting methods I'm going to fill you in however if a listing is going up in competition and down in price unfortunately that trend is probably going to continue and that's something you want to avoid typically what causes this is a deal being really easy to fine like a coupon being super clear on a website or maybe an item got
on a leads list for example that'll occasionally happen but if you're buying stuff that's nice and protected using the discount methods I'm going to show you in these videos you're not going to run in this stuff super often so if you see a product like this you definitely want to avoid it I get out still the time how much competition is too much competition on a listing I'll probably say this several times throughout these videos it's all dependent on the trend cuz there are certain listings that have
80 sellers but 60 days ago they had 70 sellers or 90 sellers but the price is still relatively the same and the volume's just crazy it's selling super quick that's not too much competition but on a list like this it's clearly too much competition because the price started going down as the competition went up the demand didn't meet it so you want to avoid stuff that has the trend of competition going up or Price going down or one of them because they typically lead to the other this next
one's kind of a controversial take and it's just overall a question I get all the time should you compete with Amazon on certain listings now there is some Nuance to the answer this question because the answer is sometimes not always but sometimes and the reasoning for that is Amazon shares the buy box on some listings and doesn't share the buybox on other listings luckily it's actually pretty easy to figure out which ones they're sharing the buy box on and which ones they aren't just taking a look down here on
keepa so if we take a look at this listing specifically right here we can see when Amazon's out of stock here the offer Count's nicely moved right when Amazon's in stock the offer account moves a lot less and if we hit the data and then buy box statistics right here on key right we can see that Amazon's getting 96% of the buyx share no wonder there isn't good offer count oscillation right meanwhile on this listing we can see that Amazon's in stock sometimes but the offer Count's still nicely moving even
when Amazon's in stock so if we take a look at the data buy box statistics on this listing we can see right here over the past 90 days yeah Amazon's only getting 24% of it so clearly not all Amazon being on a listing is created equal so so this data buybox statistics tab is really really helpful in terms of identifying whether or not Amazon's sharing the buy box and if Amazon is sharing the buybox there's typically not going to be people undercutting we can see price is nicely stable on this this
this listing for the most part you're also going to see from time to time certain examples where Amazon's way above the buy box and automatically avoid something when they see Amazon on it I would recommend digging into the Nuance on this stuff guys we can see this is a listing where Amazon Shar and buy box here we can see that's been the case for a while we can see this listing right Amazon's not really sharing it at all another question I get super often is how much buy Box share should Amazon
have it's kind of all depends on how the CID chart looks CU it's completely relative to the volume of that specific product if Amazon sharing 10% of a 500 rank listing that's selling insanely quick right that's way different than Amazon sharing you know 80% of a listing that's a 200k rank where it where it sells a lot slower even though Amazon sharing the buy box a lot more so make sure you dig into the data buy box stats and look at what the keyboard chart actually look looks like to gauge how
much buy Box share Amazon's actually selling and this next one is super important guys and that's going to be variations that sell too slow I get asked all the time how do you tell which variations sell best or which variations sell worst on a listing that has a ton of different colors and sizes like a shoe for example because we can see this listing is an 11k BSR which is absolutely fantastic however that doesn't mean that this weird colored shoe on the screen right here is selling really really well
is going to be using Common Sense around the color and size obviously black and white is going to sell significantly better than checkered for example right here black and green and then we can take a look at the keepa chart here as well guys and see we don't see much action on this right there's not much offer count going up and down or anything like that the price is really nice and blocky right or really not nice and blocky and we see on this size in color which is significantly more common it's black and navy there's a lot of
nice price action going up and down the competition's going up and down right so this is a perfect example of a variation that's moving nicely and an example of a variation that's not moving nicely here now I am also a fan of the variations tab on keepa a lot of people like to gauge performance of different Variations by taking a look at the review count right here and filtering top to bottom you just click this right here I'd recommend pausing this video and going in and changing your keepa
columns to match mine that's an insanely important thing because when I'm looking at the variations tab here I can see how the offer Count's moving right here really nice and easy right so that makes the whole process a hell of a lot easier right here but right filtering by reviews that doesn't take into account how long a variation has been around so that's why I really like this offer count tab right here to see the specific offer count oscillation of a specific variation which is really helpful to
gauge the performance of it right so the big thing is if you want to know which variations sell best variations Tab and then Common Sense around color and size as well as taking a look at the offer count oscillation specifically right so we can see this specific variation doesn't move much this variation moves a ton right and we can see has moved a ton for a while as we can see specifically on this keeper chart so those are a few examples of the types of frogs you want to avoid selling if you guys got any
questions about that make sure you let me know Down Below in the comments let's get right into the next module so in terms of specific product research criteria you guys now know what a good product looks like and what a bad product product looks like but if you're taking notes at home I want to give you exact product research criteria that you can build off of and eventually build your own criteria based off of right my personal recommendations are $3 profit per unit 30% Roi you can go a little bit
below that for beauty and Grocery and Pet Supply types of products but you want to stay above that for shoes specifically because customers return shoes a little bit more for the most part you want to stay below a 150,000 sales rank as well so 150k BSR however there are going to be occasional examples of prods that do have a higher BSR that you can see nice movement and nice price action on Kaa you want to make sure there's no I peak in PLT history you want to make sure that keep a chart looks good that the offer count
is going up and down ideally trending down or stable but you do want to see movement in it like we just took a look at and then you want to make sure that the price action is either stable or going up specifically and then the cool thing is over time in terms like avoiding price tanging and such you can take advantage of merchant fulfilled as well as the better you get at finding deals and getting products cheaper it's going to make your sourcing a lot more efficient and you're going to avoid a lot of competition as well because the
harder an item is to find the less competition you're going to deal with so in terms of basic product research criteria $3 profit a unit 30% plus Roi excluding cash back Credit Card Cash Back Rewards Etc so you typically get another 5% from that as well offer count stable are going down price stable are going up do not automatically avoid stuff that doesn't have a buy box and do not automatically avoid stuff that Amazon's on make sure the listing is actually moving taking a look at the keepa chart and overall over time you're
going to build your own product research criteria as well that's a basic framework just to start with and now let's get into what you've been waiting for live product research this is the most important part of the course in terms of breaking down everything you guys need to know to find and break down products as well after the live sourcing section I'm going to walk you guys through a ton of specific product research tips and tricks I don't really share other places so make sure you guys
taking notes and much more importantly implementing the stuff so you can grow your Amazon business fast all right guys so now you know how to use sellam you know how to use keepa you've seen a bunch of winning product examples you've seen examples of the types of products you don't want to sell now let's talk about how you actually find winning products the product research method I'm going to show you for this video is going to be storefront stalking otherwise known as looking inside the storefronts of other sellers
to see what they're selling to go out and take a look at those items prodct so to start off we can see these black shoes are currently buy boxing at 87 they also have a really good sales rank here a 17K sales rank we can take a look at the keeper chart and see they're nicely flowing up and down so we know that these actually sell right taking a look over on the Nike website they're going for $48.
97 here so if we go ahead and plug that in we can see that's pretty close to being good here however Nike has 9% gift cards with card cookie today Shout Out Card bear for that discounted gift cards are such a hack guys you need to consider using that right so say we get another 9% off right here we we plug this in we can see $18 profit 41% Roi and we can see there's 15% cash back currently on nike.
com as well which I'm not necessarily an account to the margin but it definitely doesn't hurt so the reason I like storefront stocking for beginners is the other way is manual sourcing where you manually go on a website and look for products and reference over to Amazon see if they're profitable when your brand new you don't yet know where to look but with reverse sourcing otherwise known as storefront stalking that mean the same thing you can actually see tons of examples of vetted products that other successful sellers with lots reviews are selling
and then just go ahead and look for those items profitable so the way I'm going to do that here is actually scrolling down here and seeing all the other sellers that are carrying this item here on selling app so now I just go ahead and open up anyone that has a decent amount of reviews you know couple dozen 50 plus Etc here we can see that review count 2,000 see 50 right here for example and then now pretty quickly we're going to be able to see a ton of examples of products that these sellers are making money on right so for example
if we take a look here we can see this seller's got a ton of different Nike products and then a few other brands we can see their top categories here they're selling mainly clothing shoes and jewelry right and now we can scroll through here and see all their fast selling listings here 81k rank 13k rank 43k rank 17 10K rank Etc right and so as you scroll through these different seller storefronts guys we can see new examples of Brands to potentially sell right different categories and different products overall so we can see all these
different uh items these sellers are carrying here right we can go ahead and take a look and see all this stuff here as we go so pretty quickly we're picking up on tons of additional examples of the type of stuff we want to sell so as we're scrolling through we're taking a look at the sales rank on these items as well as the Max cost here and seeing if we realistically think we could be profit at that so it's like do I think I could pay 15 for these shorts here they're a 3K rank potentially right so
all we got to do is open up the amazon product page here and we'll take a look little 4K rank right here we'll take a look right here and you can see you can go through all these different seller storefronts here and see all the different stuff they got so like for example 100K rank right there that potentially looks good 113k rank Calvin Klein here that potentially looks good right Calvin Klein tank tops right here for example when you just basically scroll through all these sellers and open up stuff that you think could be
profitable right and then you just go ahead and plug it in on Google and we'll see what we got sometimes you also you know filter into specific brands for example here like say you want to look at like only Under Armour stuff for example right here right then we just want to find all the Under Armour stuff that has a good sales rank this seller is carrying so 165k rank right there we'll take a look at right here 54k rank we'll take a look at right here as well right so now we got a bunch of listings
up and the nice thing about storefront stocking is really quickly we can find literally hundreds of examples of products resellers are making money on that have proven sales s on Amazon and now all we have to do right is go ahead down here to the variations pick out the best variations that we see her selling for expensive prices that we're see her ebing and flowing up and down and then go ahead and plug these in so for example I can see movement here I can see movement here being that the offer Count's going up and down and I can see
movement here right so we can just pick out a couple of these and start plug them in on Google see if we can pick these guys up buy boxing n 4 43 want to go ahead and pay like 20 for these for example so let's go ahead and plug this in we can see okay I'm not seeing this uh maroon color that we need yeah nothing matches on those no problem let's see keep digging through the variations here see anything without a buy box as well here oh yeah check this out so there's these red ones here pretty expensive 41 up here actually
sold some of these before as well let's see so let's plug these uh black and gray ones in for example here let's see let's see yeah so where my eyes go guys is that Max cost of 22 let's go ahead and plug this in see if we can pick these up for 20 or so we can see that is not the case occasionally when you're Googling stuff like this you'll come across stuff that you think you know looks like a deal that you'll you know go ahead and potentially look at as well like for example at 15 I could see those
being good so like if we go ahead and plug these guys in let's see Nike Venom shorts just black white here let's see let's let's see here so yeah we can see no reviews there so I doubt that sells well are those the uh same thing no so it's got that white on the side there let's see so yeah we're not going to worry about those no problem let's keep rolling here let's see so probably not anything to do with those here let's see damn look at the pricing going high on this buy box here up at 170 wow so
can we pay like 90 for these for example interesting okay so let's see kicks crew I think kicks crew is a reselling website unfortunately um if you're ever unsure about verifying that if a website's legit uh we can see so this actually does have good cash back here and it's on one of the cashback portals so we can realistically assume that this website is legit personally I'm not a fan of buying off reselling websites though because it's typically harder to prove authenticity even though if it is
a legit website right here other good places to check for that is going to be trust pilot Google reviews and always check out through PayPal and you can check out the website social media as well that would be profitable just not personally a fan of that let's see see 11.
5 here see up to 170 I think Stadium goods are similar I doubt these would be profitable in the first place here yeah 160 pan 100 on that so that is yeah so we'd lose we'd actually make 18 bucks profit and 18% Ri so that's actually relatively close here it's just not a site that I would you know feel comfortable I could prove authenticity from there so not going to worry about that here let's see what else we got here staffords right here let's see got these wow 44 here interesting so we can see we're looking at the variations tab
to identify the best variations here I can see lowest price is 44 we know these actually sell too looking at the offer count going up and down here right so let's see if we can track these guys down properly this is a two extra large oh so it's extra large tall as well I'm surprised these are selling so well right let's see here oh okay here we go this them so this is a four pack here yeah four pack then we need uh so big tall here okay big tall ones aha yeah check it out okay here we go so we we're here at 34
right and then we have uh code mommy for 30% off so 34 times 7 here right and then let's see what the gift card Situation's like on JC Penney I think we got a winner here let's see yeah so pretty heavy gift cards here so we can see like between like six and 16% let's say we take the average of that and say we can get 10% off with the discounted gift card here go ahead and multiply this here right and now we're getting pretty close here um this doesn't have a buy box so I know I can fbm this um and
we can see that the price is a little bit down here but there are people fbm at like 21 here and we can see the price have been high in the past too so let's see so it says this weighs 2.65 lbs I don't think a couple T-shirts are going to weigh that much I think this is probably an example where I might risk buying this and weigh it I think it probably does weigh under one pound so say I fbm this right here which we'll talk about later in the course and I fbm this you know five bucks for example or
550 right here we're getting $760 profit in a 36% Roi and let's see if the cash back's good too here so we can see okay I don't think JC Penny has cash back they might have reward specifically right there we can see this has been profit a lot in the past like we can see this was hanging out here at like 45 and such so even at 45 right there fbm right nine bucks profit 44% Ry plus any rewards and such we might get that's an example of a good product guys right and these other ones are going to
be pretty close here so these are the kind of things I would put on an almost good spreadsheet and selling but that's nice and Prof there y'all let's keep it moving here let's see 35 for these tank tops here let's see so I found them in the past profile let's see 35 for these tank tops here Calvin Klein let's see three pack tank top Pros they have any sort of Mother's Day sale going on okay so they got a pretty good deal on underwear here but I yeah okay so we can we can buy these for 46 and sell them
for 35 so we lose 24 bucks a piece uh that is not good whatsoever here is this really really nowhere discount here 46 yeah nordrum okay here we go 1997 here let's see three pack classic tank let's see any of these variations here okay so this is only a white medium so let's actually copy and paste this in and see if anywhere else has this if there or there's other listings here let's see and we want yeah Calvin and climb let's go ahead and plug this in here aha yeah okay here we go so these
are both moving well here so this did have the IP alert on seller amp this is a pretty experienced seller that's selling this so I I assume they probably not but you always want to do your own due diligence and look at the CYO chart to see if there's any IP complain history let's see so this is a higher sales rank here so we want this three pack here so this is interesting right cuz Amazon's on this and Amazon's getting buy boxes is a really interesting example of uh rarely will you see that much price volatility and
stuff let's check the variations here though and see if there's anywhere that's uh good that's not looking weird like that let's see so let's uh have Amazon selected here and let's uh get Amazon out of here by going equals and then no value major Pro tip there so let's see so we go here see and then okay so Amazon's only on the black ones here which we can see they do not have no problem let's keep moving here all right let's see 3 five here pretty much same deal three pack
yeah so we could pay you know 20 for those but that's not good no problem here let's see got these Nikes let's see 13k rank right here infant todler black white let's see what we got let's get Amazon out of there we know yeah Nike doesn't really carry Amazon ones themselves or Amazon doesn't carry Nike stuff themselves let's see so we got some nice moving on the offer count here up at 76 let's see what we got here and then the cool thing is we can see you know we can open up tons of other stuffs
for example I'm not going to open up these because they sell pretty slow here right but for example let's let's get some Adidas listings up here for example let's see yeah onek rank right there we can open up that onek rank right here like we got a bunch of good variations potentially right here let's see these are all same listing right here too let's see 17.
6 let's see Nike Flex Run two little kid let's see these little kid okay here we go let's see so yeah they got a 2.5 w right here so let's see 12.5 ah so 12.5 CES out of stock okay let's see any of these other ones expensive here let check these out let's see so yeah 11 little kid at 73 here oh yeah here we go check this out so here we go so 40 right we got heavy cash back with uh with uh a couple of the extensions there so let's see if we plug this in this is going for 74 here right pay 40 right 15 bucks profit there right is this the right item too
let's see flexx Runner here let's see oh these are not yeah these are these are different yeah Flex Runner there just do it okay cool so that's not good let's see you always want to make sure it's the right thing let's go ahead plug this in though and see here let's see plug this in here black white let's see ah yeah here we go Al those are different too yeah okay so we are going to pass on those here let's see boys here that actually is the right listing here though let's see any black and
white ones expensive here see is good sales rank too yeah 113k that's cool let's see what we got here that's the nice thing about storefront stock is all these things are prev vetted here as well so let's see any black and white ones expensive here do not think so's see they have that Picante red they do not no problem keep rolling here let's see Nike Dunks I don't really like selling uh hype stuff like this people return it a lot um we see it's not profit in the uh oh it actually is Prof let's see if this
site's legit shop Foster here let's see okay looks like they have brick and moral locations um this tends to be a good sign here check out their social media page as well and I know see so they so in terms of verifying a site's legit I always like to check if they take Paypal these guys do generally a good sign I'd also want to check their trust pilot as well well in their Google reviews here but purely let's see does the price change okay so this probably is a retail here let's see they have like locations and stuff here
as well shop now they're uh about let's see about here found it in New Orleans okay so I'd want to look up if this store actually exists here um but if this is a legit retail here at 75 dunk low right here yeah soft Moss Pacific Moss here yeah that's the same color there sale so 75 bucks here this is actually nice and profit let's see a size n and a half here let's see yes this is actually this a this W here yeah we see because here for your beginner you take what you can get right I might not personally like to
sell hype stuff here but we can see 44 bucks profit 60% Roi it's a pretty new listing here it's only been around for 40 days however we can see how's gone up and down here so we know that that actually is a winner here too so let's see so now we can see these guys don't really see much movement on this check the variations here see if we can find any iations that are moving nicely let's go ahead here we can filter by our views here so let's see these polos here at 70 bucks like there's not
much movement on the chart but 70 bucks seems expensive looks like we probably have some pricing power yeah so we can see when this is lower this sells right so let's see if we can pay for this see UnderArmour polos so 78 25 here ah these are kids ones though I was going to say yeah that would totally work if those were mens let's see under around playoff Polo let's see sometimes I'll click around in here as well match Walmart that's definitely a good UA Tech Polo here let's see 33 yeah see Under Armor is annoying
because they got like a billion different colors here too UA Tech Polo so let's see this is a different skew here we'll look this up the nice thing is too storefront stalk and it starts to introduce you to new websites and suppliers as well like that's invaluable too as as you go let's see so yeah we're Under Armor Golf Tech Polo see if any of these are like 50 plus here in the variations yeah the sales ranks Bonkers on this right it's literally 32 like not 32k like literally just 32 let see anything expensive here yeah
so we can see Mirage pitch gray let's check those out here photo blue yeah okay Royal graphite there yes those aren't the right thing no problem let's see these Under Armour t-shirts here ooh okay this is interesting so 30 bucks here let's go ahead plug this in see what we can do here o okay so we got these cheap ones on H soccer.
com right here let's see so let's see so we're here at uh looks like some of these are backordered here they have maroon here see black white red let see so we got these youth ones here let's see all white white XL here let's see some of these are good they're I I would assume are good they're just uh backordered here guys let's see see white XL here okay check this out Under Armour Locker long sleeve yeah just nice long sleeve here so we can see this is pretty good this is is out of stock here guys we can see buying it for 15 selling
it at 36 right eight profit 54% Ro Y and the key is we can see this has been selling for double or more that 15 cost for a while too and we can see it even picked at like 39 here so this is cool what I'd also definitely want to do is see see if I can find any other discounts or anything like so let's see they have uh gift cards for soccer.
com nope okay that's always a pro tip if you want to check right there so we can see that's nice and good guys that's a winning product it's just on back order I would scroll down here on sell ramp and add this to an out of stock sheet right there so I can go ahead and check and see if this comes back in stock in the future as well right there that's a nice margin on that specifically here let's see interesting so this product right here we can see there were literally no sellers in here for a while
that's not necessarily a red flag though in that if we were the only seller on that we could set the market right so let's see these have been selling around like the 50 range since like March right so if we can pick these up for like 25 or less that'll be nice and profit when we can see I think we can here shout out JC Penny so let's see so 27 here got these black Reds here let's see black Scarlet Red here so yeah guys right so let's see and this is a large here so let's see if we plug in size large no
buy box here at 49 see we're here 27 right and then we're going to use that discounted gift card there as well right like we talked about major hack there so yeah it's 10 bucks profit here and some like this we can see we've been proudful for a while here on literally like the past 60 days pretty much the entire time we've been powerful and there was a period where no one was in stock do I think it's realistic that these boxers sell at 50 bucks for a while personally probably not um but the interesting
thing is the data is telling us that that's the case uh right there so that's pretty interesting here and let's see black and uh red Blues here yeah 27 same deal here even cheaper if uh any of those coupons work as well here so let's see so 47 right we got to make sure this consistently been there so we're paying about 25 here yeah I mean something like this too guys like we don't see a ton of offer count movement here but we have been nice and profitable for a while on this at you know 25 into 47 pretty close
right there too and the key is this is very very light as well but it's well above 25 bucks so this is really efficient to fbm potentially too at like you know $5 fbm shipping and such right there plus really good cash back too and such that's not bad and then what we can do here right as we open up and we'll take a look at some more storefronts from here and such hopefully track down some more listings too so let's see s's got like some car hard and stuff here as well carart t-shirts let's see these got
a good sales rank here 35 bucks got the carart ones as well yeah 48 K rank we'll take a look at that see we'll take a look at those as well here let's see tari adidas Originals tons of stuff here as well so let's see D this Originals we got like 30k rank let's see yeah 40K rank we'll take a look at that 80k rank for these hats as well here right you just want to pull stuff from other sellers that you see are making money on stuff and then go ahead and take a look at it right so we can see like Calvin
Klein found some other stuff there silmer type stuff jockey that Stafford stuff good sales ranks here let's see what we got let's see so carart these t-shirts here so we're going to have to pay really really really cheap these I'll probably look through the variations to see if their stuff Amazon isn't on so I'm going just hit go here and hit variations and then we want to look for movement in the offer count chart right so you guys really want to make sure you move your columns around to match mine
right so let's see dark brown medium here so if we can pick this up for 15 bucks will be nice and profitable here let's see yeah look at the stability on that stability is crazy on this it's very rare you'll see a chart that uh specifically stable for a while there let's see these brown ones here let's see 129 here so this is Prof well the if this is the right color here which I don't think it is the problem is that is that says Factory second not personally a fan of selling Factory second stuff
unfortunately I don't know if Amazon customers are cool with it I'm just not definitely not going to specifically recommended and such too so let's see so yeah I'm not seeing anything uh discount here sometimes Dick Sporting Goods will have additional markdowns in some colors of these though so we'll definitely take a look as well let's see yeah 20 bucks carart Brown let's see these guys moving for the high here variations tab let's see interesting yeah okay so these uh Marine Blues here marine blue Heather
let's see okay yeah here we go so let's see is that the same thing there I think that is yeah so you can see it's like that dark blue type of vibe there and such oh no that's got different uh different like texture there unfortunately let's see let's see Lake Shore you got that here Navy no bog blue anything up here close out these pink ones here damn see yeah we're missing like a bunch of colors of the stuff that's actually selling they just uh don't have specifically right there
we can look these up though Rosewood Heather here let's see car heart yeah no so I think we're screwed on those no problem yeah car heart site yeah so that's a shame though some of those uh colors are missing out on here let's see these ones going for around like 30 let see shers wow Bass Pro Shops okay so this is interesting right so these are actually uh it's actually profitable here guys let's see eight bucks here we'll just have to audit how much the uh price has actually been up here at 30 so
let's see let's take a look here variations we're here pretty low comp too super low comp here see yes we can see black ones 24 months here let's see so we are here yeah 15% cash back it's a shame they don't have that red one on that listing there though we can uh go ahead and plug this in though let's see 15 o okay yeah here we go guys check this out so we can sign up for uh NRC uh 15% off right here just using this coupon right so that'll take that from uh 15 I'm not familiar with this website
we'd have to go through that same beding process here we can see there are brick and moral locations though which tends to be a green flag right so let's see so 15 here take off 15% right so we do that quick math right there we can see $8 50 cents profit and a 64% Roi on a common color on a 48k ranked listing right and we can see it's only one fbm seller too so if we were to FBA this we could own that buy box right and probably buy box it closer to like you know 32 for example FBA I'd probably feel
comfortable testing out something like this and you guys can see we're just taking a look inside the storefronts of other sellers seeing what they have that selles quick plugging it in on Google and seeing what we can find profitable so that's totally cool let's keep it moving guys let's see so I'm definitely going to look up uh this one as well here let's see got the bass bro shops right here and they want Bittersweet here see okay so we can see these definitely have Amazon listings only one of them
has reviews though so this is either brand new or it never sells and we can see pretty much never sells very very blocky there um not a fan of that we'll uh we'll keep moving here let's see so you guys can see there's good stuff all over the place here let's see 68 so you want to pay like 30 for these let's see xplr let's see okay yeah not uh let's see kids XLR gear let's see so you want these white kid shoes here see so this has like that uh material here let's see let's just plug
in uh Adidas Originals women Swift run here let's see see what pops up here 81 damn these are expensive okay so this uh doesn't work this looks nice and cheap though these uh Cloud Runners here JC Penny let's plug these in here let's see D this light racer 3.0 women's walking shoes let's plug these guys in black white copy this guy over here let's see and we can see I don't see a uh matching Amazon listing here unless those are the right thing which they definitely could be here let's see 54 okay so we're
actually going to be close on something like this with gift card here is there any no buy box stuff here let's see 8.5 metallic silver there let's see oh it's got the metallic silver on the back too okay San 30 bucks here see here anything uh expensive let's see okay interesting so 138 or 60 light racer 3.
0 yeah these have the uh the silver though unfortunately and we want the all black ones here yeah 54 so something like this 30 into 55 is not quite good here um this is probably let's see cuz we're at a 30 and then we can gift card famous uh JC Penney as we can see there so we see it's like 10 bucks profit 54% Roi um it's actually pretty good too JC Penny have cash back no right yeah okay now right let see hopefully I have some type sort of Rewards program here we can see uh this looks good on paper the problem
is it's not consistently 55 it's more consistently like 46 so we're going to pass on that unfortunately here let's see these caps here bunch of Amazon recently going out of stock on stuff let's see so you want to pay like 10 bucks for these D Originals caps here we can see I do not think that's possible here could be some other good deals and the stuff you want to uh take a look at that we know famous footware got a bunch of good deals there and such see Calvin Klein underwear here nice and stable too
super stable we pay 20 bucks for those here oh okay yeah here we go Packa four yep okay Nord shra here so let's see yeah classic fit brief here yep cotton classic yep okay four pack briefs yeah check that out so you obviously always want to go through the verifying process make sure everything's the right thing here but here at 19.
97% Roi also going to go ahead and plug in Nordstrom Rack and see if there's anything that matches on these guys too for gift cards 3% done really move the needle when you're a beginner maybe every dollar counts here discounted gift card are definitely aren't necessary they definitely do help though plugging that in 3% off talking about making n bucks profit here more importantly we can see we've been profitable on this for like the past like seven eight weeks here so we can see dating back to mid-march right there absolutely not bad we'll take a look at
some of these other colors and sizes too see if these guys make sense as well o okay we can see so we got clean sweep here a lot of these are cool at 20 right let's see what about uh what about let's plug that in here oops let's get that title here let's look out the black ones well cuz we can see from the offer account Movement Like These actually sell you know seven sellers on March 10th or six sellers on March 10th right here let's see can we pay 20 bucks for these as well here let's see
43 see we got here yeah super stable too look at that right yeah let's see oh H JC oh no that's jockey that's a good deal though let's see Calvin Klein pack of three now we need pack of four here okay y look at that okay here we go ah I think those are a little different yeah so we'd have to go through and figure out the uh coloring on those oh that's that looks a little in that let's see any other pictures here I don't know you always want to make sure that the stuff's correct though on stuff like
that so we're uh probably not going to worry about those what we can do is we can Google image search this though and see if they have this anywhere else though cheap here okay they got these on Macy's three pack we need a four pack though see yeah okay not going to worry about those no problem here let's keep it moving here such let's see s's got a bunch of Nike stuff too here oh bunch of low sales rank stuff yeah 1K rank right there 4K rank right here see what we got on this stuff y'all yeah 4K rank right
here as well got some hoodies too and you can see like there's tons of different stuff you can sell like you can see all these sellers got boatloads of different stuff like jockey stuff New Balance cuddle Duds I think cuddle Duds is an auto on gate too like we'll take a look at a couple of these as well here yeah we can see 34k K rank right here right we see 31k rank right here right let's take a look at some of the seller stuff y'all yeah 27k rank right here let's dig in so yeah we can see we got a
five pack okay too all right so let's see going for around 69 bucks okay let's see five pack here 54 let's see damn these are expensive okay yeah let's see so we're not going to uh worry about those unless there's some big coupon on Calvin Klein which I don't think there is check Capital One shop here now yeah the these free extensions are crazy helpful for finding coupons right rackon top cash back B Frugal coupon Birds you want to make sure you have all those just so you can notify to different deals here too let's
see tank tops here let see 26 all black ones here 27 yeah 46 pretty expensive here 27 on there yeah let's see actually was Prof for a little while yeah interesting is we've actually been profle up there at yeah 50 bucks 27 is there a good cash back here let's see oh here we go okay that's how it works so say this 10% email code works right which I don't know if it will stack with this discounts say it does though right now we're in here at 25 right this also pretty light here to so fbm nice too so we can see yeah 25
make 40% right there at that weight like we can see something like this the competition's trending up here but we have a ton of history of profitability on a product like this so this is something I might consider testing and this is the right item yeah three pack tank tops I can't believe they're so expensive there but that's the power of extra coupons and stuff guys like that 10% email code popped up makes our life a lot easier here something like this we can see the competition is recently
trending up on however we can see this definitely moves here and we have a lot of profitable history so I'd either test something like this or I just put it on a spreadsheet and come back to it in the future with seller amp there but definitely nice and profitable and that's the name of the game guys just around seeing what other people are selling finding what they got selling quick and going ahead and Tak a look at here let's see so yeah buy box top to bottom 62 164 views going down right there looks like a pretty good
opportunity here let's see so two extra large tall might be hard to find that in stock here I've definitely sold some of these in the past though let's see yeah look at that that's a gorgeous trend on the Kaa chart competition going down price nicely going up Max cost is 30 oh okay if these are in stock this is our lucky day y'all two extra large tall here see ah okay so these are H not good they're very good they're just out of stock 9% cash back on Snipes yeah so we can see there's no uh no tall sizes
there so this is very good uh just not in stock so what I would do is I would scroll down here and add this to an uh out of stock sheet in sell I always I always like default to saying almost good because I you add a lot of stuff to your almost good sheet as you're doing a lot of prodct research you set keep alert so it becomes good so on and so forth right but we can see that's uh definitely good just out of stock here we'll let check any of these other colors here on these guys good or they going to be out of stock as well let's
see 59 here the interesting thing is we can see like these sell quick when they're in stock right they're just pretty low competition and people are rarely in stock right so let's see if we can find these Navy ones here too I sold a bunch of these in 2021 as well see yeah look at these like these are never in stock but if we look historically when there is stock of them which probably means we aren't going to be able to find them right now these fly on February 88th of 2023 there were 20 Sellers and on April 10th there were
none or April 13th there were none right so let's see if we can find these anywhere here aha okay so let's see icon shorts here see we got these navy color see boom yeah okay cool yeah I check this out y yeah 20 21 Point uh yeah 21.9 7 here 2.97 right $21 profit right I'll check nike.com discount right here let's see 4% yeah okay boom plug this in here take 4% off life ain't bad on that guys let's keep it moving let's find some more winners here see check a look at some of this cuddle dud stuff here see I
think C is an auto on gate brand see this is really really stable here check variations first order of business here let's see aha yeah look at this stuff guys this stuff's moving let's see $41 here ultramarine let's see yeah look at that look at that buy box going high let's see 26 okay healing woman no Macy's here 26 let's see Bel got some cheap stuff for these okay let see tonal Buffalo 26 here so yeah we're at 26 15% cash backs going crazy though but at 26 on for 41 definitely not good
here are all these ones expensive yeah so probably nothing works there yeah no nothing works okay let's see tonal Buffalo size small okay see they got tonal Buffalo here so this a tonal Buffalo oh yeah check this out we need size small though let's see 23 okay yeah so we can pick this up for 19 even with Cole's cash paying like 15 in the 23 lose a dollar profit not the type of business I want to run here let's see aha here though okay so 11 bucks on Bel we can see Bel got 2% cash back too I happen to know
Bel has good gift cards as well so if we go ahead here pull these in car bear pull Bel up here let's go ahead and pug this in you guys can see like with storefront stock and we can get reps so quick right yeah we can see on the low end 10% gift cards here on Bel right so we're really going to pay like 10 bucks here so like at 10 bucks here we're making making four bucks a pop 40% Roi we just need to gauge on keepa whether or not this is moving nicely which we can see something like this has a lot of
history higher than this we can see as of about the past six weeks here it's pretty consistently been hanging out here profitable even before then it was significantly higher at 38 we can see this also sells looking at the movement here on uh keep a chart offer count right here that's cool right and we see how we dug through wasn't good Macy's was good Belk is good that's the nice thing about name brand proxy guys right so we can see aha I did just realize I think the pattern's a little bit
different here unfortunately so uh unfortunately going to pass on something like that so that's my bad you always want to check and make sure it's the uh the right thing I get a little excited sometimes too but that that's the nature of the stuff like I want to show you guys what product research actually looks like here let's see 37 let's see what we got here let's see so yeah this guy looks great here let's see could pay 10 bucks for these here climbing right by cuddle Duds okay shout out
Walmart 10 bucks here let's see see I just got the straight up there okay all right so yeah 9.97 here 38 one mark on any coupons yeah 05% cash back we'll take it okay so we can see just this basic leggings here the same at the bottom there too see it's got the crease there as well yeah Okay cool so so we see right there nicely hanging out here ton of Prof Lister you always obviously want to make sure stuff's the right thing there but that looks cool take a look at these gray ones as well here see we'll take a look at that too
yeah cuddle dods like the nice thing is leads are hanging out around each other like horizontal scaling is my favorite way to do this right figing out okay are there other good variations are there other brands that are similar to this that looking inside the storefronts of other sellers we can come across and learn about right it's the same exact process to Source all different types of proxy here guys with the stuff and just figuring out identify winning procs luckily in this free course you guys have seen 20 plus examples of what that
looks like or at least 15 already here in the examples and just Source in here as well we also haven't looked through all the variations as well go ahead and open up these listings on your own and store Front stock these listings to find more stuff here obviously makes no sense to necessarily buy and try to flip any of these prodcts were much more importantly just speaking conceptually in terms of what finding wi prods looks like and even just in the storefronts of these SS we looked at we literally found
thousands of examples of fast s products already and all you need to probably not have a 9 to-5 job ever again is have like a hundred of them listed at any one time so let's see I like to look at this at 12.6 here I'm definitely not seeing these leggings anywhere in gray that I think will be good here but we'll uh a well these guys here actually too let's see tono Buffalo see they got this uh color that was eluding us there a couple minutes ago let's see aha these are the right thing I think yes okay all right
boom we see and I don't think so CU that the top of it a little bit different there all right okay so this is I you know I don't wear women's clothing so I don't have a great gauge of it here let's see cuddle Duds see okay we want gray here okay yeah have to take a look here yeah plus sizes here nope all right we'll keep rolling here no problem see want these uh women shorts here as well Nike too see let's look up some more of these Adidas listings as well here y'all oh we already looked at the boxers here let
see 26 here let's see stuff like this looks a little bit expensive so we got the kids ones a little bit cheaper here yeah like we could look up all these individually I just don't think any of these uh specifically look like a good deal here let's see want to pick these guys up for about 20 see that is uh does not look possible here analyzing all these different prices that actually looks good though Alpha Edge Let's see how those are different here no problem let's see we already looked at those
here see what else we got so yeah we got oh jockey stuff too here found some good jockey stuff let's see 88k rank right there that looks pretty good anything else a good sales rank yeah 23k rank right there let's see million rank 300 928 yeah some of is interesting this is going up in price even though the ranks they are really high we can take a look at that too let's see okay these are tanking in price not a fan of that see that here ah these ones though we can see yeah there is some good movement on this stuff here
you can see a couple of these guys trending down here let's see 45 here so I want to pay like 20 so plugging this in on Google here let's see are these uh oh these are men's ones so that's a problem because the kids pretty similar one here yeah 25 so we could pay like 28 with Go's cash just not quite uh good enough there so we're not going to worry about that okay actually JC Penny here let's see so we're out here at yeah 27 right and then we can take off 30% from that 27 here take off
30 right uh gift card as well here this is very very profit is this the right thing here let's see it's got the blue jockey logo on each of those there so we can see that is nice here and at 31 we're still pretty close something like this a little bit riskier though um just because it's mainly like 32 there so it's like eh your downside you're probably not going to lose money but there is a chance that you only make like a 20% Roi which definitely isn't what we're looking for here we'll take a
look see if any of these charts do make sense though consistently here let's see 23 okay definitely not what about size large here 37 okay this could be good here so let's see so you got 27 plus the mommy code let's see and then we take off 10% here 37 here see nice uh under one pound above 25 bucks really nice fbm Arbitrage too on that so let's see 5.
5 here it's like eight bucks profit so something like this here now this is a replan here check this out we've literally been profitable for like an entire year on something like this right so we can see been nice and Powerful offer count going up and down as well 80k sales rank something like this is totally Prof with the couponing and uh gift card spread right there so that's cool for sure right any other variations good on these guys here let's see anything else here all black ones let's see yeah 36 that was cool
okay and I do not think that is the case here these Grays o the gray ones are cheaper though okay interesting here so let's see so this is yeah so it's this color right here so this is definitely Prof um problem is it looked like the competition was shooting up on that so let's see so let's see here yes this is definitely profle we pick it up for like 17 um problem is the uh competition shooting up and the price is shooting down so I'm definitely not a definitely not a fan of a listing like that this
listing nice and stable though let's see see what we got here 23 here see 19 on Macy's here let's see I these guys up at 40 check this out right here see 39 here okay so let's see 19 here with code Mom let's see what the gift card Situation's like on Macy's Macy's here 7.
5% off yeah okay check it out so another 6% off so we're here at 21 take off 6% right here so 21 take off 6% here boom and then we see 7 oun super cheap to fbm here so probably fbm for like 450 maybe five bucks here so we're making seven bucks a pop there super stable too we can see something like this like we've been profitable for a year straight on something like this like that's not bad whatsoever here so you guys can see these leads are hanging out around each other right that was another good one discounted gift cards
heavy cash back got to love it here y'all let's keep it moving right so we can see that stuff was cool these hoodies we didn't get a chance to look up as well we can take a look at those too let's see 11k rank right here so let's look up these hoodie see we can do here let's see yeah some of these are expensive wow 3XL up here let's see so these are going for 100 so we got to pay like 50 for example here let's see what we got so yeah let's plug these guys in see gray hoodie here so we need a 3XL
that we can discount let's see so hibbit has 20% off right now let's see ah 3XL is not in stock let's see but at uh 53 there that would be nice and profile so that's uh good just not in stock currently any of these other variations make sense though let's see looking for yeah one that are moving quick and like not very weird Colors Let's see oil extra large extra large tall okay let's see oil green here let's plug this in see what we can do here aha oh here we go oil green and this is a
uh yeah extra large tall here so let's see boom yeah 42 check this out y'all here we go so 42 right and then we're also going to earn K's cash on our purchase here right so that gives us a further discount um right here as well so say uh cools cash we end up reinvesting and such right there so we get some product that a$ Z cost of goods as well so $22 profit there um oil green white andone see here yeah oil green white 42 moving at 88 got to love it there right now finishing off we got another winning product that you guys in
your own time can go ahead and storefront stock of as well to find other winning stuff as well my biggest tips with storefront stalking is just pick sellers that are carrying this type stuff you want to sell so like a good seller storefront they have reviews we know they're making money and then they have types of Brands you want to sell and ideally they're going to introduce you to new brands as well that they're making money on that you can make money on as well store Front stockin is by far the most simple way to do online
Arbitrage sourcing and it's where I recommend you get started with so make sure fire up sellam start off on some of the winning prodcts you see in this video open up the storefronts of the sellers that are carrying those prodcts and then use all those discounting methods we've been talking about to go ahead and make those signage Prof let's dive into a little manual sourcing action so you guys just saw how to do reverse sourcing now we're going to jump inside my screen and do manual sourcing manual
means basically looking manually through a website and seeing what profitable products they have you can see we're looking here on Famous Footwear currently manual is more work however it is also more profitable it's also harder for beginners cuz when you don't have your favorite websites yet you don't really know what a good deal looks like what websites have good procs and that's why I'm such a big fan of storefront stalking for a beginners specifically but I'm going to show you manual
sourcing on a bunch of different websites in this section of the course so that you guys can see what it actually looks like to find winning prods using the manual sourcing method obviously we're going to look at lots of different types of prods at the end of the day it is just data most websites do have good things you're going to use storefront stalking to learn your favorite suppliers learn their favorite deals learn your favorite Brands and then we're going to be able to dig in and find stuff on your own here so we
can see currently famous footware has a Mother's Day sale going on uh the cool thing is you can actually typically just click on the homepage of website this case it looks like we can't we're just going to click the sales section and then personally I have the best success with procs that's what I know best so I'm just going to go to sale and then shop by gender and hit men's a lot of websites will show the deal they have on their homepage I'd also recommend creating a burner email address and
having accounts on as many websites as possible so you can consistently get fed deals and know each time your favorite websites have deals going on either way you're going to be getting emails from them all the time because you'll have purchase from so you'll just be getting fed deals all the time and stuff I like having that separate email address in the first place too so we can see in terms of stuff that's on sale for famous footware there's currently 2,000 skis right that's a lot of skis there's
probably stuff that's profitable in here personally I like to then filter down to the types of Brands I like to sell at the end of the day guys obviously it is just data if you're seeing brands in other seller storefronts there's a good chance it's reseller friendly if you can see other people making money on it specifically for this case I've had a lot of success on Nike procs with Famous Footwear so what I'm going to do is go down and where it says brand I'm going to filter specifically into Nike skes
right now we can see okay currently there's 54 Nike product that are on sale here so now we can see that's not really a ton 54 so I'm actually just going to go here and hit sale and then shop by brand and hit shop by brand total for Nike so now we can see there's 200 Nike procs that are on sale currently and each of these we actually get 20% off additional with the code mom day20 and there's 15% cash back with ragon I personally don't like factoring in cash back into my buy cost however if it's
one of these days when it's big I might focus on these types of websites that have the heavy cash back a little bit more so now as we're going through here guys we're looking at these items we're taking off that 20% so like I see 32 on this this one's promo code excluded that'll happen from time of time this one's 28 this one's 28 and I'm thinking to myself could I see this selling for double or more on Amazon right we're looking for common color type stuff luckily it's pretty easy to tell what's
going to sell well after you've had some experience storefront stocking so we can see like at at 32 I could see this potentially going for like 65 plus right at 28 here these big kids once I can see those going too right so now as we scroll through here these two are promo code excluded we're looking for common color type stuff that we could see selling for expensive on Amazon so for example uh right here at 58 promo code exclude in the first place don't really like those these are kind of weird
colors and such not really going to worry about those these Court Visions here I've had some success with those here we'll have to add the card to see the price though specifically we can see um these Flex experience at 57 I can see that's doing well right and we're just all getting another 20% off specifically on here so let's see Air Max sc's at at 58 or 53 or whatever that ends up being with 20% could see those doing well here so obviously not all of these are going to open and as a beginner why manual
sourcing can be really inefficient if you don't yet know what a good product looks like is because you might open up a ton of stuff and then have none of it be good meanwhile when you do storefront stalking a lot of stuff ends up being good cuz it's prev vetted and other people are selling it basically if that makes sense right so we see these shower slots sold some of these before too right so now we can see boom not really liking any of these guys here I think they're a little bit expensive and such
right here let's see what else we got here these Yannis shoes at 50 minus 20 down from 85 that looks like a potentially good opport te and such here so over time you're going to build that tolerance and that muscle a little bit better here but let's personally dig in and see if any of the stuff becomes Prof let's see yeah 28 or around there I think that looks good here um tangents here at like 48 I think that looks good as well here let's see so page two so what I like to just do with manual in
guys is I like to open up a bunch of SKS and then just kind of dig in and cross reference over to Amazon one by one and see if anything's good here so let's see so these boots here we're picking these up for 24 so all we need to do is copy this over put in Nike here and let's look this up on Amazon and see what we can do so right off the bat here right we can see there's a listing here with 80 reviews that's at uh let's see 44 so this actually going to be pretty close here so let's see so right off the bat
we can see okay ranks a little bit High 240k however if the Cuba chart shows movement this could still totally be good so we can see yeah check this out guys like the rank's high on this but if we take a look at this Cuba chart we can see the offer Count's gone up and down so we know that people are making money on this product right so now we just need to hit the variations and see if any of these are you know what are we paying 24 yeah see if any of these are like 48 Plus for example here let's see
so we can see we got a bunch of smaller sizes 11 11 little kid ah yeah so we got four to four to 10 toddler here let's see yeah so these half size they don't have those three little kid here let's see yeah they don't have those either okay so it looks like they're missing the sizes we need so no problem that's a pass here let's see these tangents and black white we're paying 48 so we need this like 90 plus right here this in see what we can do okay oh we got to include Nike in
that as well you'll kind of build a feel for what you need to include in the search here so let's see okay I don't see anything that even matches these specifically let's just go Nike tangent black white women's see oh yeah okay here we go so let's see yeah here we go so we can see this have 1100 reviews so we know that these sell well we'll need to just see if any of the uh the colors they have which is black on black and black on white are profitable here so we got a first order
of business hit the variations here and then let's see yes so we can see yeah black on black 85 here so let's see we're paying 48 here so yeah it's not going to work 85 let see yeah Walmart completely different product here so let's see so we're paying 59.98 here 59.98 and then we want to take off 20% from that right so we can see here oops times point8 here we can see yeah so about $13 profit and a 28% Roi so this is not good however we can see in the past this has been really good here on keepa I'd want
to add this to an almost good spreadsheet and selling here just with the one-click export feature and then I also want to set a keep alert so I can be notified if this becomes you know 90 plus again for example in the future as it has in the past right so let's see okay this guy men's offc Court sandals interesting so some of these siid are actually out of stock here guys so this could end up being good here so let's see so we're just going to copy and paste this in reference go to Amazon let's see what we got here okay yeah
here we go check this out so size 11 here yeah okay here we go so we're we're at about 28 so it looks like we got a couple different listings here so we got this one that's up at 65 that has a specific size so it's attach so the rank's probably a little bit high but the keepo chart might still look good so okay so we can see this is definitely profitable here at 36 take off 20 so it's like 28 the problem with this listing here guys even though it's profitable the velocity is really low we
can see the rank is 2 million right there's not really much movement at all in the CUO chart so we're going to pass on a listing like this let's see and then this guy here let's see so we're paying about 28 here let's see so are there any black and red ones that are expensive here okay size 11 here at 41 yeah so buying for 28 selling for 41 on Amazon definitely not good not going to worry about that here let's see and that's the nice thing is like you know as you're doing this you can get a lot
of reps in quick you know what I mean like if you're looking at sites youve made money on like and doing manual sourcing on them like you start to kind of build a feel for what you need to pay what you need to find Etc here let's add in like white white here and see if we can find a specific listing oh 85 here okay so let's see that one 63 here we'll take a look at as well feel like there's got to be a main listing here let's see men's modern here that's a weird title though let's
see any of these have variations oh here we go okay yeah check this out so here we're paying 49.98320 and such 80 plus here aha yeah check this out okay first should be first winners of the day here guys so let's see so what uh so we got 9.5 10 10.5 11 and up to 14 okay so I got a very good feeling about these basketball shoes people like them high let's see so size 13 57 bucks definitely doesn't work what about a nine and a half here yeah that there we go and then this one's good it's so interesting how the uh how
the market can change like crazy so yeah we're here at 84.9 to so check this out guys $22 profit a 25% profit margin a 54% Roi and we're getting 15% cash back and famous full Rewards program and if we want to juice the margin a little bit more we could use a discounted gift card from cardbear or top cashback as well if they have them for the site so we can see here right this is profitable here and then if we take a look at keepo we can see the price is actually or we need to get this refresh see this specific
keepa here let's see so this one should be the specific keepa boom yeah check this out guys so we can see here if we take a look at like the past you know month here we can see it was briefly down at 76 that's not the end of the world here like that's still probably about a 20% Roi let's see yeah that's still 35% Roy that's cool right very briefly at really the lowest it's been for like three weeks here right if we take a look at the buybox stats right here we can see average price here so we
can see there's been a ton of people that have sold at 78 and 84 and even 85 133% of the buy Box share going here at 85 that's a nice profitable product over time there W see so that's cool like that's not a bad item whatsoever guys and it's all just hanging out here on these different websites and us as online Arbitrage sellers can clean up on this kind of stuff right so we can see 9 and a half was cool let's see if any of these other sides are good too that's what I like about shoes there's a lot of
scale with them so we can see yeah 40 bucks right here that's close that's a little bit low Roi for a shoe however has it been higher in the past here we can see this thing's totally trending in the right direction and there has totally been some profitability here specifically back in like October and such um like that so that's uh that's fine there I'd probably pass on that now I'm sure you guys are wondering it says a 78k rank but it says 47 sales per month if we take a look at here on
the sales rank on keepa we can see that this was a detached variation for a little bit and then it was returned to its main parent listing and estimated sales is based off the historical sales rank of a listing so even if it became a detached variation for a little bit that can make the estimated s is a little bit misleading here however we can see the whole time the offer Count's been nicely going up up and down on this proct so we know that it actually does sell that's a winner there black and red ones good
here too let's see variations any black and red ones yes 75 no let's see so I like filtering here and seeing if anything o 88 here okay 9.5 in the black and reds oh okay so 48 here into uh into 88 here let's see so we're here at 48 let's see so yeah 16 bucks profit 33% Ry however buy box is an fbm seller so typically if you see an fbm seller in the buy box you got a pretty good chance you can FBA it higher because Amazon gives more buy Box share to those types of sellers here to FBA sellers so say we
go this at 92 now becomes good and we're getting 15% cash back and we're getting rewards as well we just need to make sure that the chart looks good here which we can see there's totally been history here out of 48 uh buy cost here guys that's been profle personally would pass on this and probably wait for it to come up but it's not the end of the world if you did want to grab some like this and come from an abundant perspective and price above the buy box that don't see so that's cool right so
let's see this listing yeah yeah this one's in a million rank this uh this listing so this definitely isn't good here my eyes immediately go to that right let's see what else we got here interesting check this out yeah here we go what uh what size is this so this is a uh okay this is size eight which unfortunately was out of stock definitely is profit though out of 40 buy cost so we're going to pass on that unfortunately here definitely is a definitely is profitable there unfortunately but uh out of stock that's
a nice thing over time like if you're tracking replin correctly you're going to get notified of stuff when it becomes good all the time let's see so we need ah so this is a please select delivery method let's see not Store free Pi wow so these are all out of stock here interesting yeah okay so that's weird so I don't even know why they showed if they're all out of stock but weird glitch on that website here let's see Nike Air Max SC black black here let's see what we got plug these guys in O
interesting okay those the same thing um I don't think so see how that suede yes I don't think there might even not be a listing here let's see these guys the right thing no that's a different material too okay weird would expect that to be a listing these might be the right thing let's see all block here see yeah I don't think so unfortunate all right where I weird I would expect there to be a listing for those let's see that's the nice thing with manual guys you can get reps in so quick you know if
you if you know somewhere has good procs which after a little while you will know like you can get pretty good at finding stuff pretty quick I just like learning via storefront stalking let's see okay black on white wow 106 here 9.5 wide all right let's see wide yeah all right here we go guys check this out so this is a 9.
5 wide we're here at 66 we're going to take off uh 20% from this so 66 time 08 it's going to take off that 20% here right current buy box is 10691 here right this is good we just need to make sure the keeper chart looks good which we can see yeah this has been profit for a while here check this out guys yeah we got pretty much uh since February profitability here so several months right there 15% cash back too uh that's an excellent product there guys and that uh I believe is it in stock to ship yeah yeah literally like ship ship two address that's beautiful any other
variations good here and the key is like we know it sells quick we know it sells considering we see the off count movement right there profits good right and we see 66 take off 20% brings it down here great cash back too absolutely no complaints and then yeah look at this this 11 wide's good too at 105 that's awesome and it it looks like uh yeah this should be the right thing there Flex uh yeah Nike Flex there Nik Flex you always want to look closely occasionally I might miss something but if I'm doing a perch you I'm I'm doing
my due diligence and so just that's cool not bad whatsoever here guys let's see cord Vision here let's add these to cart let's see 50 bucks we're paying about 40 bucks for these so we need them 80 plus here Nike women's Court Visions white gold Nike let's see what we got here aha okay we're going to be close here guys let's see what we got okay so let's see white gold here so we need these at 80 plus this is size 10 size 10 in stock here ah okay ship to address yeah only a
few left here okay we see not sold in stores so at 40 bucks here we're here at 40 bucks right for the past like three weeks we've been profitable here um we can see price did Trend a little bit down here though right so say we sell this at 77 here um some people would pass on this some people would take it uh personally I can see 10 FPA on it 10 fbm on it if I'm coming in on that I'm probably going a little bit higher FBA and I know I'm getting 15% cash back and this is a finite deal that's probably
not going to be around a ton longer because it's Mother's Day but if we look these up here we can see yeah check this out so we can't get these cheaper 50 on DSG it's a different product 80 on champs this is probably a little bit of a scarce deal here right so we can see some people would say s this kind of on the iffy side of things I think the 15% cash back probably pushes me over uh on something like this here cuz we can see yeah we do have a lot of profitable history on something like this guys this
has been around for 221 days we can see been nice and profit in the past probably the kind of thing I would take a take a look at or strongly consider and I would also look at all those other sizes too let's see Nike kids ones right here see we got all right let's see so we want uh red Flex Runners here aha here we go okay let's see okay so we got a boatload of different siid here let's start out little kid ones here 50 bucks let's see so these are big kids these are little kids here so we're paying
yeah like 52 or sorry no uh yeah wait 32 here right so let's see what we got yeah so about a 4% Roy not going to take that we'll take a look down here at the uh variation see if there's any red ones that are expensive here and I really recommend pausing this and making your variations column match mine it's very very important there see okay there's a billion different variations on here let's see Black and Whites anything up here come on really nothing take a look through some of those other colors and
such as well here ah 12 little kit okay here we go let's see and they got that here yes let's see s pan like 32 so 32 here yes let's see so 10 bucks profit right definitely fbm friendly as I can see right there right and then let's get this refreshed here see yeah I mean we do have some profitable history on something like this it is majorly inflated recently though so I'd probably pass on something like this I'm surprised that on a big kid Nike Flex Run is cuz it was interesting the little
kids were less expensive than the big kids yeah the big kids are 28 here okay interesting so let's see let's see child flex two running ah okay here we go 3.5 big kid rare wi C 3.5 boom let's see we got a 28 here aha yeah okay here we go yeah these are good okay I I had a good feeling about these let's see no buy box do not automatically be afraid of stuff without a buy box here lowest price is 65 we can see 65 free ship is less than 56 plus $9 ship it's pretty much the same thing um specifically right there
so we can see 65 right here this is actually a banger product here so let's see so 36 take off 20 right with the code right there into 65 18 bucks profit here uh very good sales history as well no buy box not a problem we can see this listing still moves right here and we're getting 15% cash back as well so that's what it looks like to manual Source we website and let's jump in and manual Source another website too cuz obviously famous fwar isn't the only place we want to look I've bought from probably over
100 plus websites during my online Arbitrage career storefront stocking is going to help you show which websites carry which product what deals exist you'll be able to unlock scale and depth with manual sourcing let's jump into website number two website number two we're going to be digging in and doing manual sourcing on is the Puma website a brand like Puma that's a little bit smaller than like an Adidas or an Under Armour for example obviously Puma sold at a lot of different retailers however a lot of the
profitable products I found have been primarily just from puma.com specifically and we can see this weekend we can get an extra 20 with code extra 20 here and for whatever reason the Puma website glitches on my Chrome I know that happens for some people as well so I'm going to be looking at it on Safari and then referencing over and then for the 15% cash back I just do the mission cash back function on rackon here so let's see we go shop now here right now we can see all the different skis that exist here right we see 2,000 products
going to go into gender men specifically on this because I tend to have a higher hit rate here and we see like I was talking about when we did famous fwar we're looking for stuff we could sell for double or more after that 20% off right so it's like something like this could I see these going for 100 plus I don't really think so could I see this t-shirt going for 20 plus absolutely right so I'll open that take a look at it let's see what we got here so we can see I'm not going to open up variations
that I see multiple times here like these here at 28 could I see those being good potentially right let's see so we already opened up those here these shorts here at like 12 bucks I could see those going for 25 right let's see these slides here at 11 see black and red ones I think I've even sold some of those specifically let's see so we got these shorts here yes so looks like lots of slides 28 bucks here looks like a good deal for the viz Runners as well we see the black on black ones even cheaper
here like 26 right so let's see and then I have sales stacks back on Z obviously too so we don't need to do any Mental Math so yeah that was interesting so these guys I think a different version of them was up top there for way more expense but at like 28 like I could see those working 30 bucks 28 here let's see 26 here like 24 for those looks good right let's see I don't really think I see those going for 70 right uh we already opened up a version of those let's see these guys 36 right do I think
those could move at like 60 plus I think they could M right maybe 28 here and uh need this moving at like 56 let's see what we got let's see cont demies here 28 right so you just want to pretty similar to famous full you just want to open up a bunch of ski you could do you could see doing well right and then just one by one go and reference over to Amazon basically and over time your hit rate's going to Skyrocket as you get better you get a better feel for stuff and the nice thing is these sales Cycles
repeat themselves like I'm filming this during Mother's Day Memorial Day is coming up Father's Day is coming up Fourth of July is coming up it's going to be a ton of good opportunity here and then for the people are really sharp you saw this extra 20% both of them don't stack unfortunately but I like the way you guys are thinking with that in terms of stacking the extra 20 with the 20% email code that exists right here too and such so let's see so we got these uh bungee shoes here so let's see so we're
paying the low for them yeah we're paying like 28 let's go ahead plug this in see what we can do here see we go bungee shoes here okay right off the bat we're going to be close on something like this let's see let's see what we got so yeah 54 here so we're picking these up for about 28 bucks flat right let's see go here variations let's see and then we need to see if any of these guys make sense okay 54 54 here yeah okay check this out they got a size 13 in stock here we can see yeah yeah 13 and 14 so
we're here at uh 35 here right so 35 and then we want to take off 20 here right into 54.9 five we can see that's decently close to being good this is a higher rank higher sales rank it's like like 250k so we need to see if this actually moves here which we can see yeah so something like this totally does sell we can see it had 5 S in February now it has one there obviously isn't much movement late because it's just that one seller hanging out on it now a pro tip here something like this is
about $8.60 profit and a 31% Roi now there is really good cash back however I saw that it's one seller and that seller's fbm and if I'm coming in an FBA in this there's a good chance Amazon's going to be give me the buy box at a higher price so I'm probably going to go at like you know 6 7 10% higher to test out here so maybe 5850 here right and that brings this to 12 bucks profit pre cash back pre any rewards that exist I don't think pluma hasn't knows but You' find it on
Google here right now this becomes something where this has been profit for a while here right and you see how there's Nuance in terms like this item is profitable but it's one fbm sour so there's a chance I can price at higher FBA for a Savvy seller like myself I might try that out right so we can see starting off here got about 40% Roi on something like this good cash back to something I might consider testing out here let's keep it moving let's see serve pro shoes right here Puma right
and that's the nice thing is like when you know where products coming from you end up having a decent hit rate let's see so we're here at like 26 here see what we got oh okay so all right yeah five million ranks so not the kind of thing I want to sell um kind of surprising I did expect those to be good but yeah look at that in the variation here here where I'm looking at the off count I can see like pretty much zero movement so um surprising but uh I guess I don't know let's see is there a
different listing here for these though okay so I don't think so unfortunately so let's uh keep rolling here and see what else we can do got these red Demi shoes here see I don't care at all like what product is I'm all just you know hunting for data that makes sense to Arbitrage stuff order it to ourselves ship it off in bulk if you're confused about the ship process I'm going to show you guys that how that works as well that's actually the easy part finding process stuff that takes
skill takes a little bit of time to get good at here okay so let's see these Demi shoes here so let's see there's this listing here let's see oh 8.5 that's black we need red and black though let's see okay damn so they might only just have this one uh one listing here let's see oh is that the right thing soft Right End Zone no okay all right so I think we're screwed on these guys see 36 16k rank see yeah so they're all at 44 it's probably that one seller so let's see yeah yeah shoebacca
right there so sure we could price a little bit higher here but at uh you know 28 and 47 or whatever that wouldn't work so let's see smash 3.0 shoes so something like this I'll probably include the color as well in see I'll copy that color over here just like assembly line it like doing stuff like that on cart.
com especially too let's see okay yeah not liking those and that's the thing like some of these I might just plug in on Google right like for example like if you're seeing stuff that's selling quick why not give it a quick Google and see if it's Prof anywhere you know because like people are clearly buying this stuff if it has a bunch of reviews here so let's see 58 let let's give this quick Google here let's see okay oh actually wow here here we go okay let's see so serve pro black let's see oh these are coudes those are
different yeah okay and serve pro light here yeah okay the cly ones are a lot more expensive they're 80 bucks right there so that's not going to work these look like a deal at 23 here let's look this up you guys will see the uh the Puma website's going to crash here let's see I don't know why it does this to my Chrome but it does here see white yeah see it goes to page not found right there 15% cash back definitely busting though let's see serve pro oh these are unisex okay let's
copy this URL over here let's see all right let's see so 28 here see black black Puma say black here all right and yeah so off the that not uh not really seeing anything that uh makes sense here maybe if there's the all black ones on this though let's see I don't think that's going to work though let's see yeah so we're paying we're paying the high for these yeah comparatively so it doesn't work no problem let's see black on black and obviously not anywhere close to everything's going to
be good but you can get into Rhythm and check Stu pretty quick here O Okay this looks good here all right check it out guys so we're paying like 24 ooh we need the block and gum though okay good good okay okay so the the seller color is going to work here so we can see yeah unknown fees here so that's the interesting thing is these actually have sold out like these were out of stock for a while which is definitely not a problem if you ever run into a listing with no sellers I would just match the price like look at where it's
historically been or check how it sold when it wasn't stock to figure out if it sells in terms of figuring out pricing on that just look at where it's historically been and price higher basically so let's see variations here yeah okay not really seeing much movement offer count right here so not going to worry about that let's see temp Demi black on black right here you don't have to like you don't have to like an item to make money like these are some ugly shoes here but if you know we can
make money on him you know don't discriminate here all right let's see oh was that was that the right listing too here oh soft right ends us okay contemp Dam yeah 44 let's see yeah the rank's like two million so we're not going to worry about that let's see just copy these guys over boa block let's plug these guys in aha okay here we go so what are we paying here we're paying 26 okay we're going to be close on these guys guys okay let's see oh and we got the wide ones too they okay so the wide ones are a
little bit more expensive that size 10 might work though let's open these up though see 54 here so yeah we might actually be good on these guys let's see variations here all right and we need the black on black one so yeah 49 here so let's see we're going to be pretty close on something like this like if you're know sales tag this might end up being good here so let's see so 33 take off8 here so yeah some like this we're pretty damn close we're just not quite there it's about 25% Ro y there is good cash back
so some people that like to count cash back might take that here um going to pass on this unless the uh history is a lot higher here let's see which we can actually see that's interesting here guys check this out so the buy box currently very briefly here is at 49 but if we take a look historically it's mainly been 54 here so is that 7 and a half in St it is yeah okay interesting so we can see here if we take a look at where the buy Box's actually going there's been a lot of history at here at
54 which now we're making 38% here we're getting 15% cash back there might even be discounted gift card potential there too that could be totally be cool we can see the sales rank's good on this estimated sales was low that's just because there's been sometimes the sales rank shot up here in the past however we can see this definitely isn't the quickest mover in the world but we can see it has the offer count has gone down especially even just you know recently the past couple of days here seven down
to three this does sell the buy box is predominately at 54 we zoom in here on keepa so this actually does make money and it's $10 profit 38% Roi and I got shipping sales tax everything like that factored in so this could be a winner for your business you know especially if you're in one of those no sales tax states are the white ones on here too let see 37 here 11.
5 these aren't quite going to be good here but that that yeah that was cool so let's see yeah so we're here at like 30 into 50 not quite there let's see yeah 38 50 yeah passing on that unfortunately sweet so we can see so that black one was cool let's keep it moving and see what else we can do here this slides here black red see Puma black red see what we got oh okay 25 here so we're going to be we're going to be pretty close let's see so let's see here yeah 28 here black red o okay let's see we got some fast selling listings up
here guys check out their review count on these let's see so we're paying like uh you know like about 12 bucks here so if there's anything 28 here size 10 okay let's see size 10 here so let's see interesting so this is 25 currently in the fbm buy box right so we see you're paying about 12 right however if we take a look historically things been hanging out here for the past three weeks at like 28 here right there's some people that would say yes to something like this here you know like 29 and such
right here right at like 28 personally I think it's a little bit riskier for beginners um however there's definitely people that would say yes to this here at 12 and a 28 historically especially with where it's been um recently and such let see any of these other guys make sense though see we got Navy ones down here see white oh yes these are yeah 35 let's see these are with a strap here let's see do they have these 35 here let's see oh yeah wow wow even cheaper here okay so 11 31 so something like this
here this is interesting right 11.19 here it's like eight bucks profit uh this has moved like this offer Count's gone up and down here like people have totally made money you know at at here so I I think that's probably a winner right there so this probably is a take here guys and I definitely want to take a look at some of these uh other variations here because yeah this thing's currently buy boxing at 36 right there's three FBA sellers two fbms probably look to FBA that just cuz like do you think you're going to pay less
than bucks fees like obviously maybe I just don't really think so right so we can see that could be a total winner and that's what's so important about being able to navigate the keepa variations tab correctly I would so recommend guys take some time screenshot this go ahead and organize your variations tab correctly here so you can see like yeah 35 this thing's got no reviews but it was out of stock and it sold out from two sellers on April 2nd down to zero on April 5th right and the ROI is like 100%
so you have a ton of pricing power to potentially come in here in undercut too right it's like historically yeah we can see like there's not much third party history on something like this but we can see yeah there's one seller there at 38 or 35 right there paying 11 like that could be a winner for some people's businesses let's see let's see oh we got that other listing too here see here cool cool cool all right let's see is that other oh Puma that's the thing like you can just do what's
called Leaf sourcing too and just plug in like Puma black white men SL slides right here like and like see if we uh find a hit for these let's see black white 23 we going to have a shot on this stuff you know's see looks like uh going to be no buy box stuff if anything here see oh it's that same listing there yeah let's see so yeah we can see there's a bunch of them that are close at an 11 cost personally probably wouldn't feel comfortable with that I just think it's a little too
cheap um sub right there however these ones are good Pro tip here if you find variations that are great out you can see if they have them on the variation WIS that are in s Central and you can bring listings back from the dead and actually see their keepa history just by going to SAS do.
com and opening them up let's see so Essentials see Puma black white here let's say puma black white let's see Essentials 12in shorts right here O Okay so we're paying ah 12 that's a little much let's see any of these guys going for the high here o the white and black ones oh so it's just Grays okay let's see we'll see if they have variations out here okay yeah rank's a little bit High rank's kind of all over the place too let's see and the rank can be high the keepo charge just needs to look good
okay all right gry Heather medium gry Heather all right all right here we go when wow check this out okay 12 bucks here Ray when see these are moves like look at that up and down here like people have made money let's just take a look at the keid chart here it's not the quickest move in the world here let's see Yeah medium gry Heather P black medium gray Heather okay let's see ah yeah yeah check this out out so this is a pass so I mean Amazon's on it but we can see there's been times where it was
like 18 so I'm uh definitely going to pass on something like this unfortunately some people would take the risk and match Amazon because there is like a 75% chance historically not personally a fan of that though let's see yeah and this one doesn't have enough velocity here so let see okay not liking those here yeah and that's like you can just open up these other listings and see if anything makes money here like let's check these guys out top to bottom here yeah these black and white ones black white with the strap
here size 10 36 you start to get a feel and like a wiggle for what stuff sells for too you know like let's see black white with the strap okay so we don't have black white with a strap I don't think so unfortunately I definitely want to look up these guys too here see we got black on black with the strap at 11 though let's see anything makes sense here ah 29 yeah check this out here we go guys so you can see 11.
9 here so 11.19 here 50k rank so it's check historically here like yeah guys check it out like we got a good chance of making money on something like this if if we take a look at the last year we can see the buy box has predominantly been hanging out at like 30 bucks there there's times when it's a little bit lower here and you want to Auto your own wrist TOS you'll build the musle over time here but if we take a look here at the buybox right over the 365 days here we can see the vast majority of the time we're making money
on some because like I literally think 100% of the history where there's a buy box we're making money on this obviously there's some time where it was out of stock as well but if we take a look here at the average prices when there's a buy box the past 365 days literally every single time we're profitable on that so I love this uh data buybox stats feature on Kaa too so that's absolutely winner here too take a look at a couple of these twoo because I like the uh like the look of these as well oh it's a
million rank though let's see Puma smash I've definitely sold some of these Puma smash sneakers this is called Leaf sourcing where you just look through Amazon here so yeah it's like a yeah there's 10,000 reviews like people are clearly making money on that stuff let's see go to variations here oh 14k rank okay see let's give this quick Google figure out oh they're going for the high okay classic cour yeah they're going for the high on puma.
com okay I don't like that I don't like that let's see Navy suede though here those are a little different Navy white because hibbit there's actually a good discount on too right now yeah let's see Navy SL white so that color looks a little bit off I might even want to like hit up hi and maybe see if that uh see how yeah it just doesn't look that pearly way let see probably not can rock with that guy here R that's a nice thing though as you're looking through this like these other listings that are popping up here
that have a lot of reviews like people are making money on that stuff you know it's just like taking the time to and on such here and just plugging everything in so let's see black red here definitely I think the uh couple those shoes were the winners of the day here let's see 70 bucks here yeah no reviews I doubt that's moving well let's see viz Runner yeah there's a different there no problem right so as you guys are doing the stuff on your own right go take a look at some of these and see if
anything makes sense you know I mean like there's some cheap stuff like those black and gums of these guys were cool couple of the sly listings were cool shorts had a shot maybe I would dig through all the varation see see if those were good um as well and such here so we can see there's lots of good opportunity out here guys with manual sourcing right these cleats like 20 bucks I'm pretty sure these are actually profitable let's see let's see yeah we're we're paying like 20 bucks for
kids and and soccer Seasons coming up these kids men's want kids here oh these are men's oh these are men's cleats lit okay here we go these are good yeah so we see yeah they got all siid in stock too okay as long as the boss is good 50k rank game time here so let's see so is Amazon sharing the buy box here enough it definitely looks like so considering people are selling out here right but if we're at 20 bucks yeah we making 50% like clockwork there we take a look here at the yearlong this probably replin too
honestly and I assume the price might pick up too yeah check this out so we can see yeah Amazon's got 60% of the buy box for the year right people have totally made money on this is something a lot of you know experienced sellers would say yes to you know 10 bucks profit on a $20 purchase 15% cash back as well life could be a lot worse that was how to manual Source on Puma or much more importantly how to manual Source in general let's get on to our third website all right on the manual sourcing site number three so Rock Room Shoes
specifically is a website I made a bunch of money on especially now as a beginner because it was one of the first opportunities I ran into where you could actually stack coupons together so we can see we can get $20 off 99 plus and we can put a BOGO 50% on this so we're going to do smaller carts on these products and be able to get really really steep discounts here basically too so we can see I still got the Puma up from the last search right here so we can see so we want to start out just go to the sales section right here and then
we just want to go to kind of just keep going with the theme of just men's view all it's a lot harder to manual source for like Beauty prodcts and stuff like that cuz there aren't really many aggregator retailers besides like Sephora and stuff like that if you're going to do sourcing for those types of products storefront stalking is typically best um because like the brand websites are pretty much the only place to get the product so it's a lot easier to just let them tell you where to look
and such here so if we go ahead filter like Adidas for example you see oh only 42 items so I might even want to look through woms as well depending on time here and we know right we're getting heavy discounts here like it ends up being like another like 30 or 40% off because we're at the buy 1 G 50% off and we're getting 20 off 99 here right so we can see Swift 20 threes I could see those going for like 100 plus here let's see TR Racers actually found these profitable here before right 70 right
here we're getting pretty hefty discount so it's pretty much anything I I could see selling well on Amazon is like worth looking up here let's see so we see these daily 3.0 here in Gray cap years here as well I remember finding this like a year ago Prof one rman you see how some stuff says promotions eligible and some stuff doesn't that's a major Pro tip that a lot of websites you'll run into they make it easy to see what you can coupon and what you can't and the coupon stacking is a massive hack
for alline Arbitrage so let's open up a couple more listings and see what we can do I'm not really unless something really like screams out that it's good just at the price which it's almost never the case like let's say Dame damn the Dame ones are on clearance okay I know they just lost in the playoffs but I don't know if people are rocking with them like that let's see so yeah with these guys would pay like really really cheap here let's see TR Racers Hoops 3.
0 we'll take a look right there and such as well let's see 60 bucks here let's see ah it's like a little bit of a weird color though guys like we want to be looking for the basic basic stuff here this would be great if the coupons worked on um right there let's see let's see here any backpacks Let's see we can look up women's too let see sale women's we do Adidas as well here yeah we got 30 more SK SK here let's see what is promotions eligible see some of these look a little expensier like these are
kind of weird colors so I'm not really going to look those up here let's see 60 bucks here see uh Hoops 3.0 I've seen profitable for let's see any anything basic here ah pure emotions here okay can see that doing well here let's see Cloud Foams too let's see so yeah 60 bucks and then remember guys we're getting buy one get one 50% off and we're getting uh 20 off 99 plus blush Adidas here let's see oh okay right off the bat here okay let's see so these the same color yeah blushy okay let's see
are any of these guys expensive remember we got heavy coupon stacking on here so we got 60 bucks rare So in this case we want to do carts of four right just to break that down here right to get it above 100 for that uh here so we got BOGO 50% right minus 20 for the 20 off 99 divid by four here so yeah 160 divided by four here right and then it's above 70 bucks we just do units a two to maximize that here so let's see are any of these guys hanging out at 80 okay check this out so this is interesting right so it says 17 sales a month here
so 60 bucks it's not good that's just because of the historical rank like I've been talking about with some of these variations here but let's see are any of these blush ones heavy expensive here let's see 77 okay interesting so let's see yeah 77 here okay let's see so yeah these guys in stock ah these are seldom in stock okay any size in stock interesting okay so we can see I don't know why these were even shown in stock on the website here but at uh they're actually profitable right so let's see
buy boxing at uh 77 here so yeah 77 right so it's 60 * 4 take off that here minus 20 divide by four here we see it's about 16 bucks profit and a 40% Ri so item definitely is profitable right when see uh buy box has been hanging out a little bit lower though but there is really good rewards and really good cash back the rewards I do trust from rackam it's about 7% here so if we take a look historically like this has been profitable for a while right the averages here and such here it's just not in stock right so even that's close
to being a take if it was in stock it's not good here so we can see a 15% cash back let's check these guys out so let's see right here let's see is it just saying everything's out of stock here see see go ahead here black white here see pure motion 2.0 okay yeah 40 side I don't think anything's going to work on these guys here let's see what match is that see yes those are different no problem so let's keep rolling here guys let's see pale blue Hoops 3.
0 sneakers let's see ah okay yeah so there is there is some stuff that's in stock okay that happens a lot less than most beginners think in terms of like stuff being out of stock you do always want to track it though in a seller amp spreadsheet so let's see women's Hoops mid okay these great gold ones could be good here let's see 50 they're cheap too okay let see any of these guys in stock here okay so some size are okay very cheap too 50 bucks here let's see so let's see right here is this what they look like on the
inner ah see so yeah these are different here see how that's a different filter see slightly different there so G to pass on that here let's see check take a look down here variations see what we got one gray and now let's see white gold and then this like blue type of vibe here let's see white gold then yes okay not uh yeah okay not seeing anything good on those so we'll keep moving no problem so you guys can see it's a vly game right you just got to look at more stuff here so let's see
Adidas here see what we got oh light racer out 4.0 okay 65 here they're pretty cheap 60 bucks okay let's see L racer. 5.0 the the 4.0 is actually one of the first ever products I sold on Amazon so it holds a uh special place in my heart here let's see 68 here okay uh going to be game time are close to it here guys let's see we got a winner here black on black okay yeah check this out so these are yeah going for 70 bucks right so let's tell let's break down the numbers here so this is 60 *
4 right here so 60 * 4 right take off the buy one get one 50% right so we want to multiply by 75 here take out 20 divide by four here so we can see yeah this is about n bucks profit 20% Ry not quite good enough let's see if this historically has been profit though we can see a little bit here 75 that's close however largely in the past it's been in like the 70 range here so people are either getting this cheaper elsewhere Outlets or adidas.
com or something like that we can pay 45 take off 20% right so about 36 but that's uh not on both though unfortunately so it only ends being 40 a piece yes so not liking those guys no problem here let's see tan Hoops 3.0 men's uh let see got the gum bottom here Hoops 3.0 women's we want the men's ones though okay let's see take a look here oh yeah ranks really high on this yeah 500k so these would have to be pretty good for us to say yes to them yeah and they don't even have the correct color here it's just
the black and gum one on there no problem let's see let's keep rolling here see light racer adapt 5.0 sneakers see p us here okay and we want the uh color pops we want the pale gray ones okay so let's copy and paste this in here let's see pale gray okay 5.0 we want H yeah 5.
0 is gray okay don't see anything close on those no problem let's let's catch a winner here let's see 15% cash back absolutely Bonkers here let's see cap tier 2.0's okay let's see 3.0 here let's see what we got see Capers here see those right here boom okay yeah those uh okay yeah those are different cap tier 2 ah okay so we want the cap tier 3.0 see let's find the 2.
0 listing here all right let's see BDS see cap tier see 3.0 here damn okay interesting so it looks like there might not even be that's surprising might not be even be an Amazon list for these guys in general here let's see let's take a look here let's see want some gray ones as well here see dailies here let's see let see 3.
0 is here 60 bucks let's see what we got here I think I've sold some of these for the high before let's see yeah Amazon on them Amazon will be on some Adida stuff don't sweat it though like they if they're sharing buy box they're sharing buy box here black on black ones here let's see 60 bucks as well 65 okay that's like a denim Vibe though I think the gray ones have a better chance here but if like if everyone's good I you know I want all of them let's see 60 here yeah so we can get these down to like 40 but at 70 that's still not going
to work um what about yeah no other colors here let's see anything no buy box here oh okay so the black ones are super expensive look at that yeah 100 here let's see can we find these around 50 now these aren't on Rock room here but I'm still going to look and see if they're anywhere else you know so we see black on black here damn they got a bunch of cheap ones WSS we just want uh firm black on black though not like these weird colors okay no problem here see are not liking those let's see gold men's Alpha bals and then
TR Racers here as well let's see white men's tr23 racer didas okay all right so we got a couple listing to potentially look through here let's see see you want the all white ones here 38k rank oo some of these are expensive okay so let's see this is dark blue here got a whole mess of colors too all right let's see these uh this color here okay they don't have those see Halo 14 black white here okay so want the black gums here aha okay here we go yep yep yeah here we go so 70 bucks as long
as these check out here let's see y promotions eligible right so 70 * 2 right cuz these these ones are expensive enough here now we take off this here right minus 20 divide by two here boom there we go okay so we can see this is profitable right no buy box which could be a problem if it doesn't sell we'll need to take a look here on the keep but and see if it actually sells here so we can see yeah check this out on something like this here like you know people have sold out on this listing like this is
the kind of thing like a virtual assistant would be good to find and such we can see like this thing's been Prof like literally the past year like there's been pretty much no time where we're not Prof except this very very brief just couple days in April so a lot of people would say yes to something like this obviously you're going to build your own prodct research criteria over time just build out your own methods and such but this is the kind of thing a lot of advanced sellers would actually say yes to here 78 here pretty
similar deal let's see I got one review let's see yeah 78 free shipping that's close we're also getting 15% cash back on the two so coming some more the downside risk there but yeah that's a winner guys let's see variations here as well see what we got see so we're at yeah 64 here see they got the all black ones no let's see yeah I don't think these guys going to be doing much yeah okay so 80 pay like 40 this blue color let's see these are moving nicely though these are moving a
lot better though look at that like we can see right here like that's a good example of movement for the most part let's see so can we pay 40 for these anywhere let's see yeah it's one it's a fvm buy box seller too as we can see right there as well right so let's go ahead and pug this in see what we can do here ah run Falcon I was going to say that would totally have worked interesting TR Carbon Let's see is that that blue color 36 here let's see was that that blue color we wanted oh yeah
look at that guys okay 64 here check this out so let's check out the gift card situation too on adidas.com yeah look at that guys even better right so adidas.com here so yeah we're getting like 6 to 12% off with gift cards I mean see a card bear is really helpful for this kind of stuff so when see a 36 15% cash back as well right and we got this uh gift card finagle too let's see so we we actually even better than buying on card be here so let's see so this takes like get a $100 gift card for
80 right so that brings us around down to like down to like 30 here right plus really good cash back as well too and such something like this I'm cool with even though Amazon's on it right cuz I can see that I'm paying the low here right adding that little gift card deal in there too like that becomes even better we can see there's only certain size in stock let's check a 12 and a 13 here let's see 12 here 56 depending on situation yeah I mean that's that's pretty close it's not
quite there see a 13 let's see as well 54 yeah not quite on these either is there history though where these have worked oh totally here yeah that's the interesting thing is like Amazon's on these but Amazon ain't getting a ton of buybox sh we can see like bubo's been hanging out there on these fbm sers here right look at that I'm looking at the fbm name right there like 60 bucks like people have made money buying these and and the way we're getting that further discount right is
just using this little gift card deal they got going on specifically Mother's Day wise and such here so like that could totally work right and let's see core black yeah 64 here see it's that blue color so we can see yeah and a lot of other sides are good I think we're just out of stock on a lot of these guys yeah 56 close right at like a 30 cost about yeah 9.
5 63 right so this would just be the kind of thing we're a little bit late to but that was a great example of parlaying something we found on one website looking it up and actually finding it at a profitable price on another website too as as well so we can see the Adidas stuff specifically here has been a little bit dry but like obviously each website can have tons of good stuff so like we'll take a look at uh at Nike stuff as well are there more skes here we can see oh wow so there's actually a ton more Nike skes here yeah so let's
see right so let's see want promotions eligible stuff here that we could see selling for a lot with the discounts here let see Precision six as I could see doing well here let's see uh chiro or C slides whatever here Flex Experience let's see let's look these guys up here see what we got so let's see red here red Nike here see we got o 82 okay these look very promising right off the about here okay let's see is that the same orange there yeah okay so we can see 60 bucks let's see what we got here
size 11 right off the bat here is 82 so let's see so we're here at UH 60 bucks so we want to multiply by four here take off that minus 20 here divide by four right yeah I mean that that's interesting guys right 19 bucks profit 48% r y like there there's a lot of profit to be had on something like this and we can see right here so something like this just spiked up so this would be a pass here um it's actually relatively close there but we can see I would pass on this unless that Trend continues let's take a look down here at
very to see if there's anything that's consistently B let's say like these guys here 9.5 here when see 9.5 in stock 102 okay Banger product here yeah and then this one's consistently been up there it looks like it's consistently been at like 94 there's like this guy here we're paying about 40 bucks I believe with the math there 30 bucks profit 74% r y so like the Adidas stuff was a little bit dry on there but then we open up the Nike stuff and we see like that ends up being a great skew there with the coupon
second it's promotions El to there guys right so let's see other ones yeah 92 95 here right went see there see it's got that shading right there see that should be uh should be the right thing there red right let see right there 95 and it's got like that uh you see it's got the back there too and such so that's cool right that's that's a good product right there let's see let's keep this guy rolling here let's see these slides here let see okay none of these are the
right thing let's see there really not a listing that uh works for these guys here all these guys are sound okay we'll see they might have these on here let's see all right so let's see so want to take a look at the variations here first order of business and let's see black red here okay so we got a couple different colors here with that black red one 67 here black white yeah 54 not even promotions eligible so that definitely doesn't work here let's see okay SE yeah so yeah they're 50
before all the deals these are going for 70 55 so it definitely doesn't work there no problem let's keep rolling here see what else we got here Precision sixes let's see downshifters as well take a look at those here see what we got here downshifter sneakers okay all right so we got uh let's see so we got a couple different colors here so we got black on black black and blue and black and white okay all right so this is a weird listing where there's like random color showing on it too let's see size seven
they're not going to have that though let's see got any black on blocks here oh okay 85 here this is a 11.5 let's see so yeah promotion is eligible let's go so we're going see we're here at a 65 Time 4 and then we want to take off that buy 1 get one 50% off right so I want to multiply that minus 20 divide by four here we see 16 bucks profit um we see there's a uh fbm buy box too so we should be able to price a little bit higher than this FBA right and we see yeah see how see how it's going back and forth between like
81 fbm 87 FBA right so if I'm tossing this in looking historically I'm I'm putting this minimum 85 to start right and I'm also getting good cash back and good rewards too on something like this like this is profitable right fbm bu box always a good sign that we can price higher FBA or match fbm ourselves right here some of these other sides work too right so you want to just you know take a look through these set keep alerts in certain places and such and like there's good products on this stuff here guys
right and it's just like that's the name of the game is digging through these sales sections finding stuff that aligns and then going ahead and take a look at it and you know seeing if you can make him money like we'll take a look at these uh Air Max systems as well here systems sold some of these a year ago actually got them on rack room too let's see oh n oh 97 okay all right we got a very good chance on something like this let's see so size 12 here yeah look at this thing going to the moon going to
the Moon there so let's see so we're here at uh yeah 80 bucks 80 * 2 times right there 75 minus 20 divid by two here we see you have about 20 bucks profit um it has consistently been more like 90 however it totally is trending in the right direction something like this if I were going to test super light and try to FM it because it's clearly more of a temporary Market based on that recent price increase but either way as you do this more and more as a beginner you want to test nice and light and then
over time you're gonna buy more and obviously I don't think it makes any sense to buy any of the products you see in this videos a lot of these deals will have ended to you'll need to wait a while for them to come back or not not wait a while but till another season but either way it's more important that you guys are implementing the stuff that you see on your own starting with storefront stalking and then over time you're going to build a skill and then you'll be able to manual source as well let's get on to
website number four and obviously I manual Source on tons of websites that aren't just the ones you guys see in this video in fact a lot of my favorite ones obviously not going to show ibly in YouTube video but that is a major mistake a lot of beginners make is expecting that we're buying off like these weird little websites when it's pretty much just like a lot of the big ones you see in these types of videos here so let's get on to website number four if you made it this far in the video you're probably really interested
in making money with Amazon as soon as possible I want to let you guys know that if you're interested in getting around other Amazon sellers which was a massive thing I did when I was a new seller I have a completely free Discord Community with tens of thousands of other Amazon sellers and a bunch of additional bonus and exclusive content that if you're interested in joining is completely free I'll leave a link Down Below in the description to join the completely free Discord Community the Amazon Launchpad I started with my buddy
fields of profit who's another awesome Amazon FBA Creator so make sure you hop in that if you're interested in getting around tons of other Amazon sellers introduce yourself let every know where you're located your experience levels Etc and that'll be a great place to completely free find other Amazon sellers to Mastermind Network and build bit so hop in the free Discord at the link Down Below in the description let's keep moving with the free course guys I've always had a special place in
my heart for hibbit I actually bought tons of shoes back in the day before I was even selling on Amazon from hibbit so I've always had a good feeling about them and such they have a 20% going for Mother's Day so we're going to dig in and see if we can find any stuff profitable hit's one of those sites where you can just see the deal advertised on the homepage and then just click into it right so we're just going to do basic manual sourcing take see what's got they got on sale and the dig
in here so right off the bat we can see there's 13,500 results right so that's a lot right so let's filter into some brands that we like Caren like for example like Nike stuff at the end of the day though any brand you see other resellers Karen we can go ahead and do this exercise on right say we take a look at Nike for example here right so we can see okay now with 20% off what could we see selling for double or more right we could even go on filter and put like black specifically and just make stuff a
little bit more common here yeah we see right so what could we see selling for double or more on Amazon right here so like for example these uh softball clees I think could do well especially this season here let's go gender men's specifically and boys here let's see click both of these guys here let's see boys as well here yeah okay here we go right so we got these uh wi see right I like the look at those baseball pants too let's see those baseball fants go see all right I don't know why I don't
know why they went away specifically every either way right so let's see what could we see selling for double or more these hoods I think could do well I think I could see those being like 60 plus here let's see what else what else what else 200 yeah I don't see those being 300 socks I don't think they going to be 50 bucks here let's see what else we got we got load more here yeah we got a whole mess of skis okay there's the baseball pants let's see like these I don't think are 160 these I could see
being 40 bucks for sure right let's see these I don't think see being 300 these I don't think I could see being 40 for example Le here let's see 180 no let's see what else is cheap here Air Max LTDs limiteds I think those could do well let's see uh these at like 45 maybe occasionally baby stuff like that will go for the high as well here let's see Air Max 270s no let see I'll take a look here weird colored socks maybe let's see see these Air Max Blazers here I've uh sold a bunch of these in the past here
as well let's see got these uh see what's discount here 50 bucks uh cleats possibly with football season coming up here let's see it's like these aren't the 53 bucks for short it's is expensive that's why that's why we need to make more money stuff's expensive here but luckily thank God for the American Consumer paying the high here and taking care of us with uh being able to sell on Amazon here let's see what else is uh these hoodies here no 48 here as well let's see we've got the men's Blazers
here I can see those being 160 let's see men's shorts here and you could see how I got a a pretty decent feel for what stuff needs to be here it's like these I can see being 60 possibly here let's see short it's a little expensive here 85 oh okay I can see those being 65 let's see let's get one more listing up and then we'll uh take a look here sometimes pants can be crazy expensive too see 24 here only see those being 45 plus we got the bucket outs okay all right challenge accept here so we got a
bunch of SKS here now let's go ahead and reference over to Amazon see if anything's profitable this is like exactly what I'll do like for example I've made money on Puma that's why I'm manual sourcing it for this video to start right you do just storefront stocking and let uh you know just the the sellers on Amazon tell you what you should be looking for right and then you can clean up on that stuff profly okay oh wow okay all right so let's see so we got um right here so this is a bucket
out we got small medium large here let's see so we got these here this has no reviews um this one has reviews and just a black large here so let's see so we're paying yeah 24 here let's see so we're at here so it's going for 43 43 here need to pay 22 I don't think hibbit has gift cards so this actually pretty close to being good it's just not quite there we can see yeah it's like pretty consistent like 45 even has some history at 50 wow okay so this is not quite good it's only
3 ounces though right so fbm is going to be so kind on something like this like we go down here it's going to fbm for like four bucks where we're pretty close on something like that and we're actually getting uh good rewards too tipit 15% cash back I don't think so yeah no okay have it logged in there so we can see so that's actually pretty close to being good it's not just not quite good there however if we take a look here the past like a lot of April this was good at 50 bucks right so some
big sellers might go and take that but if you're a beginner you know you want to focus on stuff that's you know nice and profitable today let's see and then this guy yeah brand new listing here right I don't see any movement on it so I'd pass on that no problem let's see a Nike man's offc Court black white here let's see and that's the thing like you can sell all different types stuff like the the data is the same regardless right I'm just hanging out with what I like to sell personally a lot here but
over time obviously you know with Ting you'll sell a allot different types stuff in your store at one time like we saw there in storefront stock and you know people are nice and diversified here see we got Nike off cord black white here all right let's see so we got one listing right here looks like we got a couple different options here so let's see 32 see got the white black ones there too Beach and pool slides here okay yeah right here we go why why why were those not showing I don't know
let's see though if any of these are 65 plus though this could totally make sense let see oh all right size N9 here check it out guys so yeah 32 into 60 this could be good so yeah we're here at size N9 so we're paying uh 32 so let's see so 32 here right 12 bucks profit 39% Roy plus good cash back to we can see it's been hanging out there in like the 56 range predominantly we can see yeah look at this this is totally trending in the right direction across the last year price price has done nothing but go up
competition's done nothing but go down if we take a look specifically here at the last month we can see is a little bit risky over proct here over the for the past you know week or so here it's been hanging out at 57 and such right if I personally were going to test this I would probably go super light and do fbm specifically on a skew like this a little bit riskier though because it doesn't have a ton of history of hanging out up there we see a size 11 could be a similar deal here let's see no buy box
32 and we see a saw something like this that was a lot more stable there right so like we can see a lot more stability on here paying 32 getting good rewards little bit lower Roi for a shoe product however I know hibbit does have a good reliable Rewards program from my experience so we can see 10 bucks profit 30% Roi okay right not the craziest lead in the world here let's see 10K rank right here was this the same listing here on this guy too okay it wasn't okay let's see it's got yeah different items
though here let's see 45 here they got the black and reds those are on famous footware now okay all right sweet let's keep rolling here all right so let's see and you can make it a game but you can see like I'm having fun doing this you know I like it I do it a lot like talking all day about it uh to and such if you guys have any questions like let me know in the comments too let's see 82 here let's see white black here damn what the heck are these can you imagine rocking those here that's interesting
okay so these actually found earlier I'll show you guys an example we I actually found these on uh Finish Line here watch this so just uh happens to obviously not be the right thing here this is the right thing but I did uh buy these on finish line for cheap here yeah look at that 40 bucks there like that's very very cheap right we see yeah 40 bucks right so we got 15% cash back to use bson and we got a 10% code that I think Stacks with stuff that's on sale too right so we can see all white here
so if we go down here to variations let's see so we want all white here let's see 75 here pan 36 and let's see what sizes do we have available so we can see we have a 9.5 11.5 12 and 13 and like that's the thing if you're a beginner even just finding like one of stuff a day can totally work and see it's got like that speckle there as well so let's see so 9.
5 cuz like if you find one product a day a month later you have 30 products like that compounds a lot let's see so this is yeah 60 right here so that doesn't work let's see size 12 here 70 okay yeah check this out at 36 this going to be close here so let's see so 60 so 70 bucks here right we're paying 36 here right this is cool right at 13 bucks profit if uh on a day like this you might focus a little bit more with that 15% cash back that's in there um Finish Line's been reliable with cash back for me in the past if we take a
look here historically right there's a lot of time when we're happy paying 36 on something like this guys and we know it sells cuz we can see the offer count nice ly going up and down on this stuff too so this is a pretty good situation guys on a on a lead like this here and we can see right 13 bucks profit 15% cash back here as well right let's check some of these other ones too so let's see so we got a 9.5 here as well oh 9.
5 is great out so we'll check variation Wizard or we'll probably have to pass on that unfortunately Let's see we got 11.5 12 okay 11.5 here yeah oh that was the one we already looked at let see 13 here as well okay here we go so yes 60 oh no not good my bad yeah 36 we would lose yes we make 12 bucks or uh yeah make four bucks 12 ver Roi GNA pass on that check those blazes though Nike Blazer here see okay I don't think these are going to work take a look that here see variations oh they briefly touched 100 right there let's
see and oh yeah there's a billion different variations here too okay so let's see we got white black here we're paying like 82 145 here is actually close um that's still not uh quite going to work though with the one to two roll so not going to worry about those see these uh cleats here want to sell these at like 80 all right let's see okay and I do not see a match on these guys either no Pro well Vapor Shark cleats oh yeah those are the same okay let's see these guys going for the high though they actually are we just
got to make sure they're selling interesting wow okay so interesting thing is this is a really really high rank here but this is the kind of thing I really might keep an eye on cuz like people have made money at that buy cost here like 78 and you know 79 here like 17 bucks profit 41% Roi like that could be a lot worse there and uh such but uh yeah I mean it's a million rank so we need obviously a lot more proof this actually sells here and such we can see like people have totally made money like it's up at 80 right now like some big
sellers might test something like this honestly especially because uh we didn't see the s rank got a ton better last year as we were getting into like the more seasonal time for football gear and stuff another just Pro tip this is kind of manual sourcing it's called Leaf sourcing you can look up just Nike football on Amazon and see what the algorithm showing you in terms of finding types of stuff to sell so like if we just look up like Nike baseball or whatever you know I mean just seasonal like you can find stuff all the time
just uh you know just looking just like that and such let's see kids Blazers here I don't think these are going to be good but uh the men's ones definitely weren't good let's see unisex troud Blazer oh we got a couple uh let's see okay little kids here too oh okay so that they got they got hella sizing on these okay so let's look at both listings here see really high rank here 105 though 13 little kid let's see black on block here ah yeah these ones don't have the Dello on let's see so it go here little
kids here 13 little kid okay they got that oh they do wow okay let's see yeah white I think these are the right thing obviously occasionally I'll I'll be wrong on stuff but you know if I'm buying I'm taking a look really specific here so let's see so these are 62 here right wow uh interesting thing is these are actually profitable um let's get this refresh and take a look at this keyo out here all right so we got no buy box on something like this here we can see yeah okay I I don't know why I was being
misleading like that the the price is actually 105 here so let's see so at 105 it's different story 16 bucks profit going to pass on something like that unfortunately here let's check this other listing though here let's see so I'm looking for colors we have with good movement okay five and a half here 120 okay 12.
5 little kid okay so don't have a 12.5 let's see 10.5 okay done out you have an 11.5 though 113 all right check this out y'all here we go right so oh it's bold though ah it's a little different though yeah yeah so that's not going to work unfortunately here yeah that's different my bad let's see always want to be sure here 5.
5 let's see yeah big kid now okay all right so no problem keep moving on those let's see these uh weird Colors Let's see like rainbow let's see here okay see what we got first order of business check variations here see what's moving expensive here 51 wow okay let's see 51 here so yeah 51 see span 28 take off point 20 here so paying you at 22.
4 and 51 60% r y check the keepa here we can see yeah that's interesting right and then we can see like even even at the low points it was like 43 which is still cool considering this is yeah 10 ounces but 4 bucks this makes it very nice and fbm friendly on something like this here too so like that's cool right let's see what else we got here y let's see black white here see we got Nike uh Kawa slides here okay see we got 66 bucks holy crap okay so let's see any of these guys going for the high three infant okay they got that
out of stock see two infant would would be hella profitable too just out of stock there we can see right here see black and white though black and white any of them going for the high three inot would be good too that's a shame that's out of stock so we got a couple good leads that are that are good just out of stock here let's see yeah that's a shame though so those would totally be good they're just out of stock so we're not uh not going to worry about those though yeah see here we can see HIIT copy and paste
like crazy here so we're uh going to get those out of here right let see Air Max LTD shoes let see we just want the black on black ones which we can see I do not think exist see these baseball pants here so we're paying 20 bucks flat here see okay 36 here see we got 39 okay whichever one's expensive here should work 39.
5 yeah okay 39 here so let's see 44 in the the buy box okay so let's see so yeah 44 here in the buy box currently Max cost 25 24 so we're at 25 take off20 here yeah 12 bucks profit 60% Roi also getting cash back credit card cash back love me the Capital One spark um if you're doing that get another 2% cash back on that we see here more consistently more like 39 here and such we see 39 we're making 38% also getting good rewards too should be nice to fpm this yeah super light here probably go for like 4.
5 there so we can see actually a little bit better at FBA even though it's a light product there so uh not bad whatsoever there y'all we can see let's see so there's uh those and let's see here these gray guys as well thank you Pro hyper warms and this is exactly what you guys should be doing like once you get some reps on your on your belt store fund stocking you find stuff that's like close to being good right take some time and do some manual souring on those websites once you know how to make items profitable that's the
key is stuff isn't just hanging out profitable you got to make it profitable typically and we see okay I don't even see anything that uh matches these guys specif okay 3.0 here good let's see I think those a little bit different here but yeah 30 let's see so we're paying right about 30 there yeah so we see now we could buy box at higher FBA but I don't probably don't want to play those games and I'm pretty sure this isn't even the right item specifically right here so that was hibbit manual sourcing
obviously some websites are going to be better than others and some deals are going to be better than other it's literally just holiday over holiday you really got to commit to doing this for 6 to 12 months so you can see a Q4 go by so you can see it back to school go by so you can see you selling out something crazy quickly being like crap I should have bought a ton more of those time's going to fix that and just putting in the work storefronts talking manual sourcing talking to other s going to make all the difference let's go on to
manual sourcing 5 manual sourcing tutorial number five we're going to take a look at Yankee Candle right here I can see they got a ton of stuff on sale if we just click into the sales section right here the cool thing about Yankee Candle and like pet supp lies and beauty stuff and you know different types of categories like that is there's typically a lot less variation so it's easier to understand and make stuff profitable basically we can see uh how many items are on sale about 600 right here so should be able
to pull some stuff um profit right here we can also see there's like special like offers like multi packs and stuff too and such we see like 5 for 27 here yeah so there's 47 results these that are five for 27 right here these uh scent plug refills here so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to get like a quick VI on like if we look up like Yankee candle candle scent plug right here yeah refills like let's see what these just go for in general so okay so we can see yeah so we're at 5
for 27 here so we're paying like five bucks a piece basically right here so what we could do is we know for a four pack we paying like 20 bucks so if any of these are like $40 plus for example we'll be nice and Powerful so all we got to do here let's just plug this in and go like 35 minimum here and let's search this up here and yeah so we can see actually some of these that might make sense like for example sparkling cinnamon here right so let's see cinnamon right then we can see a sparkling cinnamon again it looks like
there's two listings potentially here let's see do they have that sparkling cinnamon color let's see okay let's just we can just I guess plug this in on Google here too let's see sparkling cinnamon here go to shopping let's see okay no let's see Yankee Candle let's see refill sparkling cinnamon see ah yeah here we go okay check this out so here we go right so let's see right off the bat here so we're at five for 27 here also getting 15% cash back I don't know if this coupon will stack um
here I don't think it does um we can see here so we're at uh yeah 5 for 27 here so let's see so let's sh this out here so we're here oh okay unknown fees on this and it's a 300K rank so yeah whenever you see the unknown fees it means there's not a ton of um solds on these so not going to worry about this one however right here right we can see this guy here so I might actually looked at this past we can see here it's been hanging out of like 41 minimum specifically right here so if we go here
27 divid by 5 here right and then multiply by four right here we can see nine bucks profit right here and about a 43% RI specifically right here so we can see something like this is trending nicely here and we basically just dug in and figured out a specific discount here that works and then went ahead and filtered on Amazon to see what showed Prof blade on SL that I think that's a really good way to Source things and uh and such here as well was there anything else in that search that was expensive yeah six packs here going to be a little
expensive three pack here however is also going to be good too see sparkling cinnamon right here so let's see probably lower volume here too though but let's see ah yeah so something like this here definitely doesn't work we just don't see a lot of uh sales history on something like this so not going to worry about that specifically here however we can see a lot of people have made money on something like this here too as we can see clearly right here as well and such so we can even pull up these storefronts see if they got
anything else uh Yankee Candle here as well let's see oh this s's got a ton of Yankee Candle stuff right here so right off the bat we can see these are pretty Amazon dominated right here is there anything that's not Amazon dominated let's see a 14 yes like something like this here look these up these are going to be yeah send plug here sage and citrus here right best seller 5 for 27 here so something like this here probably just be about break even right let's see so 5.4 time four here Ray when
see yeah so we lose about uh two bucks a piece here if we look historically though yeah there must be some way to get these guys cheaper actually here guys I'd see I I don't know what it is but there must be a way to get on specifically cheaper this this one has a lot more offers or there's some sort of discount I don't know about specifically here right but we see all these deals here so like what else is on sale so that that was actually a pretty cool way we could run that same play here in
terms of taking a look at the too so let's see so we got these three for 12 right so Yankee Candles mini singles here let's look this up that's the nice thing is they kind of made us made it easy for us and they showed us what could be discount and what couldn't be and as you build kind of knowledge around a specific Niche this can get a lot of easier right so let's see Yankee Candle minis here Yankee Candle minis here let's see all right O Okay interesting so we can see they got like some of these
different colors here so we pan yeah four bucks a piece mini singles here okay let's see so let's see what uh the more expensive ones look like up here go here let's see six bucks okay so yeah we got these I I don't actually know how we would prep these we would just see how Amazon uh handles it specifically here but we can see six bucks so let's see so we're paying four bucks piece we're paying like 24 so those would not work think these are specifically are going to work here check here though as well
and let's see smart sent here O Okay so let's see so these are car jar ultimates see so YY candle car jar should be some multi packs as well here okay let's see see what the more expensive ones are like here so let's see so we're paying two for 10 right so let's see above 20 what the situation looks like here oh yeah card Jus 15 no 25 for three pack here let's see any of these guys more expensive cardar 10 pack no definitely doesn't work here let's see sixpack at 35 be like yeah 30 bucks for six of them so
that doesn't work here let's see so yeah there there must be a way to get these uh further discounts such here as well let's uh just in general here let's just see what uh so we looked at those types of stuff what else is that in here there's these refills and such like this as well here different typees stuff is there like can we personalize like what type of product it is here oh okay we got some clearance as well let's see what the clearance Situation's like let's see so 15 bucks so let's see large
jar candles we'll just open up a couple of these and take a look see what we can do here terms to tracking any of the stuff down here and tou here four bucks for the uh Maple ones as well fresh packs here too let's see balancing Sandalwood Rose any just other types of ski here as well three bucks let's see four bucks here scent plug Silver Birch here let's pull these guys in see what we can do here so Yankee Candle uh fragrance wax melts let see that's a nice thing when there's a retailer like this that you have a
pretty good idea that a lot of the inventory for this brand is coming from here it can make it a lot easier to actually go ahead and Source it too so let's see silver wax M so Silver Birch let's see six bucks yeah here we go check this out so the interesting thing is we can see the packaging is a little bit different here but we would want to look and verify the UPC so it's 86 860 here 86 86 and then we want 96802 96821 yeah so that's interesting thing on something like this guys we can see so at six bucks here like the UPC checks
out here right we can see I've looked at this in the past here we can see like this is nice and profit one has been for a while and this is just like a nice clearance flip here that we can see like three bucks profit here 60% Roi that's not bad and the interesting thing is we can see the sales rank is high on this however we can see nice offer count movements so we know that this actually does well here we can see the offer count went from 18 down to like 8 to 10 for example right here so that's nice
and profitable and I like the idea looking at some of the other ones here too as well so we can see that was cool especially these uh let's see moonlit Cove here let's see Yankee Candle fragrance right here moonlit Cove let's see okay we might not have one right here yeah okay I don't see anything that uh matches those guys oh okay Midnight summer wax midnight summer here no it's a three pack 18 total yeah okay three packs six no problem here let's see let's keep rolling here okay Yankee
Candle let's see balancing sandal Rose okay whatever that is 17 okay so we're here at 17s this would definitely not be good at like 12 into 17 here oh Amazon's on it okay yeah no passing on that here that was an easy decision let's see farm fresh peach yane canle right here this was the one that was super good there that was actually pretty easy how quick we could flow through through some of those variations though and such they made it easy on us here just cuz we could run those uh C which is in terms
of like the price action right there so this is interesting right so this pack one here yeah number of items one UPC check out here 20 5582 92883 here you always want to you know check that stuff on your own right so we see what's our Max cost we're paying three bucks here three bucks here so this is something where the profit per unit's low but we're making 80% right so and there's right here if we take a look there's seven fbm SS and three FBA SS so if we were FBA in this we might be able to price s too yeah
it's an fbm s on the buy box here as well right so we should be able to come in at like 13 or so or 12 right we see Rock Solid stable here and it's been all fbn people too right there's been some fbn there but I would test the S but either way it's not the end of the world there considering we've been very consistently profitable here for a while so you see how we found one thing that first session right and then we took a look at that other type of product like the candle wasn't anything filtered into
clearance and now got a couple winners really quick quick here so this is awesome like let's keep it moving here guys like let's see and I'm I'm learning stuff as we go here too so let's see Yankee Candle send plug refill send plug let's plug this color in let's see lot of two four bucks here okay 20 into eight if there is a movement here this is going to work oh I also like the uh yeah I want to look up that one too if we haven't looked up that one as well let's see see creme
caramel yeah look at this once again high rank here we see movement okay creme caramel ah so this one's out of stock here check that out so that's good oh it's in stock okay I think right here yeah let's see we would want to check UPC for sure right there let's see three bucks here pretty similar deal there and we can see nice impr Prof I'm pretty sure I'm not missing anything in terms of these being a bundle and such here but we can see yeah look at that like off count shoting down price been profit here for like two
weeks even at $9.99 here important lesson on the guys is that Amazon has this uh fee structure basically where if like something's less than $9.99 like it can actually be more profile selling it at 9.99 verus selling it at 11 so like if we plug it in 11 here we can see right okay so it's like pretty much the same thing right here see how it's like basically the same thing but if it's like 1050 it's significantly worse we lose like 50 cents even though we're selling it for 50 cents less that's just like an
interesting thing you pick up on over time here right so like when see we got some serious winners here on account here guys let's see so we're here at eight bucks so this is profitable the problem is the rank is 2 million so we're uh going to pass on something like that as a result let's see that's the nice thing is like as you guys are watching so you're getting more up speed on manual sourcing and such like that's a beautiful thing guys let's see see strawberry shortcake here 34 okay what
are we paying strawberry bunny Shortcake let's see signature large Tumblr candles okay so this is a a different product here unfortunately this is the right thing though does it actually sell though we will be the judge see it's got no reviews which is not bullish yeah okay million 2 rank so we can see here yeah I mean this is actually sold here in the past but at 15 bucks here we're nice and profle promise just not enough sales lossy for what I'd want on something like that let's see Sicilian
lemon Yankee Candle large okay so large cyan lemon here let's see okay 17 bucks definitely not good but here Sicilian lemon ah see the interesting thing is like I don't know if this is the right thing though large Tumblr two it candle see maybe description here I don't know just because the top of it different you guys see that right here it's right there so yeah we'll keep it keep it moving here let's see I like the look up we've been having a lot of success with like this type of stuff and
everything like these uh really light guys so what I'll probably do is here I'll go trending and search low to high here right so let's see yeah Bahama Breeze like let's look that up too like we can see yeah like a lot of these were good right sidekick refills let's look up those right like just these different ones here King poinsetta whatever that is so yeah like look go look up these on your own and see if they're good like there's there's probably some stuff in here and such right just further here
like let's see like we're obviously not going to look up all these I'm kind of just looking for like different types of prodcts as we go just we can see like the nice thing is like there's a lot of variations in these and you can just look them up basically and it uh you know stuff just ends up being good here a lot of cheap stuff here too let's see snowflake kisses see there any like utensils or anything here let see 5.
25 here see like trimmers here let's see let's see like there that's the nice thing is like there's endless products look there and you only need like a aund of them in stock to like most likely not need to have a you know N9 to5 at any time so yeah this is 16 pan5 definitely not Yankee Candle bunny metal topper okay interesting six bucks into uh let's see this is different though this is interesting yeah six bucks here I don't have no idea what that is but let's uh let's see yane candle here gold trimmer oh okay Chrome
all right let's see so we're here at 5.5 here 5.5 we can see that is not good has it been good in the past oh yeah totally wow check that out so this was like 16 for a while here guys so this would be the kind of thing thing I would totally set a keep a tracking alert for just going here and saying like if you know if this thing hits you know 15 again like we're going to be nice and Prof right there just setting to keep a tracking alerts like that's not good but it's pretty close to being good and it has been good in a lot
in the past check the silver one here silver trimor let's see this guy is yeah 11 bucks here so that doesn't work looks like I found it on sale at one point but at 11 bucks here definitely doesn't work there so we will uh keep rolling yeah okay so this is interesting so we didn't see that the value used to be lower right so people have probably paid that $5 when it was on clearance like that so I might spreadsheet this and say you know refreshing now every now and again and see if it becomes good here and such
let's see but that uh that gold one had totally been good there see XO2 refills here let's see Pink Sands sidekick here interesting now I uh we'll have to ideally see a picture of the packaging here let's see V visor clip fragrance two refills in Ed let's see pink sand here visor CP fragrance kit okay let's see is this actually good here interesting so this is an interesting one because we can see like this is profitable I'm pretty sure it's the same thing here but if we go 5.00 here like
it's profitable I just don't see a lot of offer count movement so I'm going to pass on something like this let's find unomas winner here let's see then I'm going to put you guys on a ton of good stuff in terms of um like Advanced proct research here in a sec as well wow okay well here we go if this is a Yankee Candle Store here like a bundle Vibe here so the interesting thing is there's actually money on this like and that we can see like we can buy the Bears thing for like three bucks and that uh other
one for like seven bucks is actually really profitable here um there's definitely lower volume here but like the low Point's 25 which is still like 10 bucks profit like some people might say yes to this and it's all fbm people too so I might come in an FBA the unknown fees just means there's not a lot of sales shery so I'm definitely passing that due to lack of velocity here let's see yane candle see King Street Point CIA see okay that is not good right there let's keep rolling iceberry
lemonade three bucks is so cheap what was this called sidekick refill Yankee C sidekick refill it's probably great storefront stalking on this type of stuff here see so this is the kind of thing where the packaging probably changed on this yeah once again just a slower move though we can see not a lot of off I'm moving on something like that no problem here let's see Yankee candle wax melts see oh here we go okay so we got to verify that these are one packs which I think they are number of items six okay is this a
see how many we got in here ah there we go though six right there right let's see description here specifications see go command F here six six wax mounts yep yeah check that out here we go so yeah three bucks here sixpack right here we see boom baham Breeze I mean unless I miss something it's actually like a six pack of these I I don't really think these are going to be 50 cents each or like 20 cents a a specific wax smell or whatever and there but another example here guys were like the volume is lower on these but like
people have made money on this and like if you take a look historically like we've had a really good chance to make a money on this over time as well here so we can see that was an interesting example of manual sourcing a website I didn't have much experience manual sourcing but we took look and basically systematized and we can see there were those different types of items that you could just search in so what I'd probably do as well you know is go back to that page one right and just search like the wax melts Yankee candle wax
melts and then just put like a you know $11 minimum here right like for example that totally works like like right here and just you know then you take a look at one pack single packs you know bundles Etc and you should be able to clean up and find some additional stuff from there and such and we can see yeah right here let and lavender let's see these are Kohl's here so be like 10 bucks on a coals CO's cash as well gift card at to here moving at 17 right CO's cash take off 20 gift cardit right there take off eight it's
like it's close right like there's an argument there and we can see yeah it's totally trending in the right direction as well here too and such definitely pass on something like that we'd want to see if that was in stock on and Yankee Candles at that uh cheaper price such which it doesn't looks like it is but uh that's manual sourcing guys like I said manual sourcing is harder than storefront stocking but it is more profle storefront stalking shows you your favorite websites and then manual
sourcing makes you your big profit right there my best recommendations is to get starting with mainly storefront stocking though so you guys saw me just do a bunch of product research both manual sourcing and reverse sourcing this is going to be section three of the course where we're going to focus specifically on Advanced product research tactics cuz your success as an Amazon seller is largely going to be determined by how good you are at product research and I want to make sure all of you guys who you know support me and watch this free
course have a great example of what you actually need to do product research you guys saw a lot of the items we found in that video we needed coupons and discounts and discounted gift cards and that's a little bit complicated if you're a beginner but once you've been doing it a little while it's second nature and I'm sure you guys are wondering which product research method is better manual or reverse sourcing AKA storefront stalking if you're a beginner I'd primarily recommend sticking to
store front stalking as well as Retail Arbitrage too right we're going to show you guys that in a little bit how to do Retail Arbitrage manual sourcing you typically want to do once you have some experience with storefront stalking cuz you can waste a ton of time looking through random websites so if you're a beginner I'd recommend doing storefront stocking mainly because every lead you look at is going to be completely vetted you already know that it's in the storefront of another seller if the
price is stable you know they're probably making money on it right if people aren't dropping their price there a very very good chance they're making money on it and that also introduces you to new brands and new suppliers as well Retail Arbitrage is just super super simple as well it's pretty much just scanning it online Arbitrage you typically need those coupon codes and discounts like we mentioned like we're also going to dig a little bit more into in this specific module here manual sourcing is great once you're a little
bit more advanced that's what I personally do a lot of these days because I know my favorite suppliers I know when they have deals I know what coupons work I know how good the rewards programs are but when you're a beginner you don't know any of that stuff as you shouldn't cuz you're newer so I'd recommend if you're a beginner primarily focus on storefront stocking and make sure you implement all those discounting methods like we talked about and we're going to dig further into that in the
advanced proct research section as well getting into advanced product research here I want to show you guys a super Advanced storefront stalking method that's insanely helpful especially for seasonal types of products taking a look at these Nike sweatpants right here we can see right off the bat they're buy boxing about 50 bucks they got 300 reviews the ranks 200k looks like a fairly pedestrian listing here here if we take a look down here at the keepa we can see if we take out the price action here we can see it
makes perfect sense what would happen to a listing like this that the sales rank peaks in the summer and then it gets really really low in the winter because that's when people are buying sweatpants predominantly however what we're here to take a look at is how in November there were 60 Sellers and in December there were six so it makes perfect sense the price absolutely went to the moon as we can see here so one this is a great example here of how the buy box can be substantial higher than the lowest price
we can see buy box is 71 right here lowest price is 46 very good example of how when other sellers are backordered AK their delivery dates are really far out Amazon will give the buy Box share to customers that are checked in and have their inventory ready at Amazon Prime that's why it's so important when you send items into Amazon FBA you price them a little bit higher that way you don't mess up the market even if Amazon displays your listings before they're fully checked in now the cool thing
about this is that we can actually see using Kea what sellers sold this at the most expensive price so the the key is that we take a look here and hit data and then buy box statistics here and then hit 375 days right here and then go here where it says average price and click there and filter top to bottom right here we can now see all the sellers that sold this at the most expensive price and now we can store Front stock right so that's the beautiful thing is that we can see the sellers who were really smart and were
either in stock or raise their price to be in stock when the price was really high and now it's like you think these people that did really well during Q4 are probably doing well with Summer products and probably doing well with back to school products absolutely so if you want to find back to school stuff go look at a backpack listing and do this exercise a backpack listing that went to the moon or if you want to do really well with soccer gear go to uh you know shinard listing and figure out when it went up in demand and if it went up in
price and then use this Advanced storefront stalking strategy to find sellers that sold this really expensive so all we got to do here guys is hit data and then buy box statistics right here and then just filter top to bottom by price and now all we need to do is go over here and we can open up these other sellers right here and then we can see right here we now have them in Amazon and then we just copy the URL right here and then we go to sas.
com which is the samp homepage boom search this in and now we can see all the different products these sellers are currently carrying so isn't there going to be some other gold potentially in there probably right so all we got to do is copy these uh copy this URL here go over to SAS do seller amp right here we can see examples of the sellers that are really smart that sold at the peak or that were in stock at the peak that probably have every season products they're taking advantage of here which is incredibly helpful so don't sleep on
using the buy box statistics on keepa to find Smart sellers that sold products at the high just using these filters and say this had happened recently you would just go to last one and now you can see who sold most recently right or who won the most percent across the year right there's so many creative things you can do within here to find good storefront stock my favorite one is taking a look and seeing who sold that specific product at the peak another Advanced storefront stalking method I really like
using is hitting data and then offers right I'm not a personal fan of looking at these so 30 days numbers I think they're largely inaccurate what I am a fan of taking a look at is how long sellers have been on certain listings so we can see if we hit data and then offers and then scroll to the right we can see when these sellers were first seen on a listing so we can see this seller was first seen on listing 73 months ago 69 months ago 68 months ago 68 months ago if they've perpetually restocked I I don't think it means
they've perpetually been in stock the whole time I actually pretty much guarantee you if these sellers have been on listings for 5 years we know they're making money on and if they can find a profitable so really good way to find if something's replenishable or even replenishable across a couple years like back packs every August or like certain toys every key4 or certain winter gear every winter we can take a look at when the sellers who were on it first started selling it as a great indication of that
and the way we find that is just hitting data and then offers and then scrolling over to the right and taking a look at when sellers were first seen on it and then we just need to click open right here nice and easy we can open up these different sellers copy their URL and plug it into sas.
com from their seller profile and now we can go ahead and store fromont stock them as normal to find what they're taking full advantage of right now and for future Seasons you're probably going to end up bookmarking certain seller storefronts that you've learned from and that you just keep seeing on different listings because those sellers have a pretty similar business model to you and using this method is a great way to find those Sellers as well as seeing the common names that are on listings you're on I'm a huge fan of these Advanced storefront
stalking methods because you can learn a ton from other sellers Amazon makes this data completely public seller an makes it really easy for you to go ahead and store un stock these different Sellers and learn a lot and get to save a lot of time and mistakes that you might make doing manual sourcing on unproven websites I'm a huge fan of storefront stalking for the Simplicity as well as being able to use the advanced storefront stocking methods on listings like this that have done really well year over year that really pop off every
year Thanksgiving plates during Thanksgiving so on and so forth make sure you guys are using Advanced storefront stalking as well as anytime a big season's coming up go look at the listings from the past year see how they performed and then go storefront stock those sellers who sold at the peak they're probably to be loading up on similar seasonal products for either the season that's coming even if that product doesn't do as well during certain parts of the Year each year year-over year that demand's going to
repeat and you can profit from it a super common question I get all the time is how many do you buy when you find a winning product that's going to vary based on Capital and experience level when you're a beginner I'd recommend starting with between 5 to 10 of each item depending on your Capital availability for basic FBA shipments naturally when you're buying only five to 10 of stuff you're not going to have your FBA shipping fully optimized the exact box size you need you'll pay a little bit more in shipping but that
does help you reduce risk the nice thing about getting started with Merchant fulfilled if you can see other sellers merch fulfilling on listing you're looking to list on is you can buy just a couple of stuff to merch field and that helps you reduce risk even more and when you merch fi you can get items listed quicker so personally I'd recommend for FBA starting with five to 10 of most things if you're looking to do FBS and can see other people fbm on certain listings which we're going to talk about
later in the course you can test a little bit lighter obviously buying five to 10 of stuff does not change your life however down the line you are going to buy heavier on certain products that's going to help you scale your business I've sold 400 of one specific asent and one day before during Q4 it's crazy the type of scale you can achieve with really good asens when you're a beginner start nice and light and then you're going to know when it's time to go heavier on stuff because you sold a
bunch of it yesterday or the FBA ship you sent out a week ago already sold before it even checked in Amazon so I'd recommend starting super light and then over time you're going to scale your purchasing quantities more and more and that's going to help you grow your business without putting in more work because it's just as much effort to buy 100 or something as it is to buy 10 or something but you get 10 times the sales and profit you just want to reduce risk as a beginner and test products nice and
light you guys heard me talk about this a ton during the live product research section but manufacturing margin and using different discounting methods is insanely helpful for online Arbitrage and it's really the number one mistake beginners make is expecting items to be profitable at the advertised price very rarely are they going to be you're going to need to use the different discounting methods I'm going to mention I'm going to break them all down here you need to make sure you're implementing this stuff
otherwise very few items are going to be profle and if you are implementing this stuff a lot more items going to be profitable and it's going to make product research a lot more fun a lot easier and a lot more profitable to start off you want to have all the free cashback and coupon extensions that's Be Frugal Retail Me Not coupon Birds cin one shopping rettin and top cashback JC Pennies right here I found a couple leads on this morning just by using this 30% code that I found on Capital One shopping it's insanely helpful for
getting additional cash back as well as finding additional coupons and the coupons you can get on there are often the difference between certain on is being profitable and not being profitable you want use all these different discounting methods and basically go through a checklist for the different websites you're taking a look at and see which discounting methods yes methods typically multiple of them are applicable I'm going to show you guys in a couple minutes a few examples of what that actually looks like in terms of
making this stuff good the cashback and coupon extensions are the first ones you want to take a look at the next ones are going to be Evergreen coupons that typically come in the form of email account and text signup coupons Dick Sporting Goods for example if we scroll to the bottom of the we it here we can see nice little 10% email signup coupon waiting for us I've used this a ton a lot of the times they'll just pop up but sometimes you can find them just clicking around and looking on the website as well so you definitely don't
want to sleep on everen coupons if a site doesn't have an extension coupon typically they'll have an evergreen coupon if they don't have an evergreen coupon you want to get a little fancy and look for hidden coupons my favorite place to find hidden coupons is looking on Google and asking customer service and it can be as simple as just Googling shop top WSS coupons and then we can see they're literally running an ad on this keyword and now we're introduced to a ton of coupons that we can use at
varying degrees of spend that make our lives a hell of a lot easier it's also important to note that certain coupons will be percentage based which then you can do any size order certain coupons like these WSS ones will be like 20 off 99 for example or 50 off 250 or whatever right and so those you want to optimize the car to be just barely above that Milestone to maximize that discount nice thing is we can see shopwss they have cash back they got coupons here they even have extension coupons as well so there's a bunch of different stuff to
potentially look at here and you want to make sure you're hitting all these different data points to see what discounts you can get on certain websites you guys just seen me use car bear and top cash back a couple times throughout the course always want to take a look for discounted gift cards as well if you can get an $100 adidas.
com gift card for 91 bucks that extra $9 profit goes straight to your bottom line and that makes your life hell of a lot of user as an Amazon Seller there's tons of examples where you can combine discounted gift card with an everen coupon or with a hidden coupon and that's what it takes to be profitable on certain items that's stuff you find profitable that other sellers don't and that's how you grow your business another major discounting method you need to be using is taking advantage of holiday sales like for example right now
it's Mother's Day weekend then Memorial Day Father's Day Fourth of July July Prime day anytime a big holiday happens retailers are running deals typically websites will advertise what deal they have running on the homepage of their website and you definitely want to make sure you have a burner email address that's getting fed deals as well so that each time a website is a deal you're getting notified and it costs you absolutely nothing to have that Gmail just created and then you just need to
create accounts on as many websites as possible and they're going to feed you deals around the clock and it's going to make your business a lot more efficient and help you find a lot more products so sales on different websites aren't always based on the holiday however a lot of them are based on the holiday and you can just see on the homepage here you can just click in and then you can see all the different products that are on sale right here and then like we talked about in the manual sourcing
section filter into specific ones once you know which suppliers have good deals on top of coupons and holiday sales a lot of websites have really good rewards programs as well for example Foot Locker has a good Rewards program Kohl's with Kohl's cach this is a really really good Rewards program as well each retailer has the different Rewards program so typically you can get educated on that talking to customer service or just looking up like doeses Foot Locker have rewards does Rack Room have rewards
which is a really good one Asos to my knowledge Asos which is a good site for on gating doesn't have rewards to my knowledge so you always want to be taking a look and seeing how many different discounts you can pile on here personally I'm not a huge fan of including rewards in your buy cost some sellers do I would rather have it be a bonus but sometimes for ones like K's cash that are so significant I will count it in CU it can totally be the difference between certain ons being profitable and not being profit another
really helpful discounting method is using a reseller certificate this isn't super helpful for online Arbitrage and I'm going to give you guys a full walk through later in the course on getting that set up however using tax demp on websites that allow it is really really helpful Home Depot for example allows it on Google if you just look up Walmart tax stt on Google you'll figure out how everything works and that's going to allow you to avoid sales tax on certain products you definitely want to make
sure you have it for Retail Arbitrage and if you want to do some wholesale on Amazon you're going to be required to have it the next one isn't necessarily a discounting method but it is really helpful and that's going to be hopping on listings quick merch field to avoid price tanking if we take a look at this specific produ here we can see this thing's going for about 2462 on Amazon in the buy box and it only weighs 6 o this is super super light items that are like above 20 or above 25 bucks but
below one PB the further below one pound the better tend to be better to FBA versus fbm just on the way the fees break down so for example this spefic product here if we scroll down to the fbm calculator on sell am FBA it's a 40% Roy fbm it's like a 57% Roi which makes a huge difference in terms of your Roi obviously fbm shipping cost is going to vary based on weight and where the package is going but you do get those averages over time and getting on listings quick fbm also helps you avoid a lot of price tanking you just need to
make sure you're taking a look in the buy box statistics guys and seeing if other sellers are fbm in that product on keepa here we can see on this specific prog tier there's a couple sellers getting buy Box share it looks like right around like 10% that's not a ton you typically want to see like 20% or more but the higher volume of product is the less total fbm the less total percent you need because you just make up for an volume and in general it doesn't hurt to test St fbm to see if you can move it because you don't really
lose much and you have massive upside to avoid price tanking if it was a relatively easy toine deal and you can sell that product a lot quicker another really good discounting method that certain websites have is subscribe and save chewy for example has auto ship right here which is 35% off your first order 5% off after that I would only do that one time in terms of making stuff profitable certain websites will repeat the discount most of them won't but getting that auto save And subscribe and save can be super helpful in terms of
making products profit on the first purchase then you just cancel and overall you just want to look to combine as many of these as possible is there a coupon is there a sale going on right now can I combine those some websites allow you to combine multiple coupons and a gift card on top and they have good rewards and it's really really helpful and that's going to be how you're going to make items profitable so we just talked about all of those discounting mechanisms but what do it actually looked like to implement
that so I want to show you guys a couple examples of how you actually manufacture margin and take items that aren't profitable and make them profitable using coupon codes discounted gift cards rewards programs and everything like that this is what a lot of your online Char purchases are actually going to look like so make sure you listen up and if you got any questions about this stuff please let me know like I've said a couple times throughout the course I do answer all the questions I love interacting with you guys so we can see
these Adidas U soccer shinguards are going for $14 on Dick Sporting Goods now over on Amazon right I saw down here in the buy box they're going for like 27 bucks for example right so at 14 bucks here right that's not quite good it's about a 20% Roi right now if we take a look historically this product did go up in price a lot during August and September so it makes sense as the demand increases that it's going to get better however right if I can find a little bit of a coupon or a good gift card for Dick sporting goods and more
importantly track it over time to be able to use it again on future orders right this item becomes profitable now if I take a look and just scroll through the dickporn Goods website typically like we've seen coupon codes pop up and stuff like that we see down here there's a 10% email signup code right here right so we can see little 10% email signup code right here right that takes this from $14 right if we take off 10% just multiplying that in selling it right down to about $4 profit and a 30% R so now we're close however this is a very
light product which if we take a look here on sellam is very very light 4 ounces but it's above 25 bucks so this item is actually pretty good fbm as well so if we take a look here and scroll down here on seller amp right items that are above 25 bucks but below one pound are typically a little bit better to do fbm with right so if we take a look here this is probably going to ship fbm for like $4.
50 cish right so FBA it's a 32% Roi but fbm it's a 40% r y now let's do it even better let's go over and see if there's a discounted gift card here on cardbear for Dick Sporting Goods right so we see over on cardbear here we can get another five eight or even 9% off specifically right so say card cookie here at 8% right we go ahead and multiply this by 0.
92 which is going to take off that 8% for that gift card right now this listing is a 53% RI after shipping fees sales tax and everything and your competition sees 14 which is the 25% Roi but we see down to like 11.5 or whatever it was which makes this item a nice profle product that if we take a look at the 3 months here on keepa has been nice and profit for a while so you guys see how we just took and made that item profitable from not being a good winning product using an evergreen coupon and a discounted gift card that's
stuff other people aren't doing that make items profitable for you so make sure you're implementing this stuff next item right here we can see these Stafford t-shirts are going for 25 bucks on JC Penney now we can see there's currently this code for like 20% off however I saw on Capital One Shopping one of those free coupon extensions I talked about there's actually a 30% code for Mother's Day right so if we plug in a $20 buy cost right here with the coupon that shows right they're going
for 38 bucks on Amazon so that's not quite Prof for there right that's about $2 profit 12% Ry not quite good however if we plug in that 255 right here and take off 30% from that capital on shopping the free extension code we go here and now we're getting close right now we're $5 profit 29% RI right and like I said I don't like counting cash back or Awards in this but during Mother's Day and a lot of big holidays there's a ton of big cash back and a lot of these websites have rewards programs
which helps too we can see Card Cash got another 10% off for us Ray got another 8% off for us card for cash got us even higher and we can see the historics on it too right so say we get 10% off with the gift card here we come in here and multiply by point by9 take out that right now this becomes even better $7 profit $44 4% Ry not a bad winning product and all I did was put in a coupon from a free extension and a discounted gift card and now that item is good another example of a discounting mechanism I really like is auto ship and
different like subscribe and save discounts for example after the product delivers so we can see this dog food's over on chewy it's going for 20 bucks on chewy however with the auto ship we can pay about 13 right it's pretty significant discount by about 40% right now over on Amazon we can see it's going for $34 right so plugging in 12.
8 here right now we're at 10 bucks profit 77% Roi and if we didn't do the Subscribe and save this item would have been an automatic pass because we're only making two bucks and 11% RI on it right we don't even need a gift card to be massively profitable on this stuff right and then we just need to make sure that the kear looks good over time we can see this is a nice example of a replanned product here guys just using a auto ship that was hanging out right there waiting for us to take advantage of it so don't
sleep on subscribe and Save just make sure you remember to cancel them once the product delivers if you don't want to make additional orders cuz a lot of subscribe and saves won't give the subsequent orders after that same discount so you got to make sure you track that correctly bigger websites tend to have worse discount mechanism opportunity we can see these socks are going for 10 bucks on Walmart right here 7.
27 over on Amazon they're going for 21 right so we can see nice $5 profit a piece and a 70% r y not bad whatsoever however Walmart has a really good high rewards credit card I'm not personally a fan of store-based credit cards for the most part I think they tend to lead to order cancels but Walmart tends to be very bulk friendly from my personal experience so that Walmart credit card for another 5% cash back isn't a bad idea to get if you plan on scaling a lot with Walmart so we'll get 5% off here and then we can also use tax exempt with
the reseller certific like I'm going to talk about later in the course which is going to give us another 5% off considering I'm doing the course with 5% sales tax factored in so now we got 5% back with the credit card and 5% off off with tax exempt for some of you guys live in California that could even be 10% off for example and this item goes from good to even better so you always want to make sure you're maximizing these discount mechanisms guys and then we can see this nice Beauty proct here
24 on the brand website on Thrive over on Amazon going for about 37 so we can see does not get close to the one to two rule $3 profit 10% Ry but capital on shopping has a 20% code for us right here so if we go 24 and then take off so taking a look here at 24 take off 20 we're now paying 19 moving at 37 $8 profit takes this item from not good to now good and that's the power of these discount mechanisms guys is you need to go through each website and say does it have Rewards program does it have discounted gift cards is there any sort
of coupon that pops up do the coupon extensions Show me anything do they typically have really good holiday sales for example can I combine any of these opportunities like we saw on JC Penney right it was on sale coupon worked and discounted gift card and that's what made it good and I know this might seem a little bit complex if you're a beginner seller however over time you're going to get comfortable at product research very very few things are profitable at the advertised price like that Walmart lead was you typically have
to make them profitable using these different methods and that's when the magic gets unlocked with online Arbitrage and over time you're going to learn new coupons you're going to learn new places to get discounts some websites are going to let you buy wholesale from and that's going to open up all different types of new opportun these where you can pay less than your competition so you can find items profitable that are profitable for you that aren't profitable for them and that's going to unlock adding new procs
to your catalog left and right and growing a super profitable Arbitrage business this specific stuff we just talked about is some of the most important stuff in terms of all of product research and the course as a whole so if you got any questions let me know down below and let's keep moving so now you guys know how to find products that are good and more importantly how to make products good another thing I see a ton of beginner sellers sleeping on is building a leads database and tracking products performance correctly all the time when
you do product res shirt you're going to come across items that are almost good or items that are close to being good or that they're out of stock or that they're really good seasonally but it's not that season right now you need to be taken advantage of that to build a leads database we can take a look at this specific listing right here it's currently buy boxing at 2679 right here right if we take a look at keepa though we can see there's been times as the competition's EB and flow down where
this price is significantly higher we see from August 15th all the way into the end of September it was hanging out at like 32 and then we can see from early January all the way until the end of January it was hanging out at 32 and it stayed up at 30 until almost in March according to the 1 to2 rule we would need to pay about 15 bucks for this to be profitable when it's moving at that price action and we see over on the mlay Norman webs site it's 18 bucks and there's a 15% code that popped up so
that takes us from 18 pretty close to being about a 15 buy cost here so if we plug that in right we can see right now we're at about a 15% Roi but there's been a lot of time guys we're up at 30 we're making money on this and it's a nice Beauty item and at 31 it's even better where it was for a month and that's the thing when we're speaking in the context of Evergreen coupons like this there's lots of examples of items that are not good today but have been good a lot in the
past and you need to make sure you're capturing the lifetime value from that stuff and the way we're going to do that is by tracking stuff correctly and that's going to be using keepa alerts where we can go ahead here on keepa and click track product and then we can get an email notification when this listing hits 31 again for example so all we got to do is hit start tracking and then they go ahead and they send us an email when this item becomes good what I also like to do is add these types of
listings to almost good spreadsheets on sellam so I just need to scroll down here to where it says all my Google Sheets that's just a one-click export feature in cell amp you can nice and easy get set up I'd highly recommend having like an almost good sheet out of stock sheet Q4 leads for example back to school spreadsheets for any of your favorite retailers as well so all I have to do is one click export this here right and then pull the URL from this and then now this is going to be waiting for us right here and then these are all
almost good items right so we can see right here I'll plug in the URL and say 18 minus 15% code becomes good at 30 so what happens when I get a keep alert that this hit 31 for example one I need to make sure that price stay sustainably but if it's been up there for a little while again I probably go ahead and do test out this product and all I have to do is copy the Asin from the email I got from keepa plug it into the spreadsheet and then it's going to be sitting right there I'm going to know where to grab
and that's the power of these everine coupons guys another example of what I mean right here is these Puma slides these have a really good sales rank at 20K as seller am shoes right here the buy box about 25 bucks we can see for this Mother's Day sale we can pick them up for about yeah 12 bucks right so if we go ahead and plug that in that's pretty close to being good it's not quite there has it been 28 in the past though cuz that makes that nice and profitable at 28 we're making about five
bucks a piece and a 45% off y taking a look down here on keepo we can see this thing's been 34 and 35 a lot if we take a look at the buy box statistics here we can see there's been tons of examples of profitable history on this thing as close as just a couple days ago like 28 and 30 for example or even you know six seven months ago 36 and 34 and everything like that this has a ton of profitable history it also has a lot of other variations to take a look at and if this thing consist St L recovers up
to 28 for a while which it has been for a while taking a look at the keepa this is absolutely the kind of thing I want to set a keep alert for so I can get notified of in the future right this isn't being bought with an evergreen coupon although if you're watching this Puma does have a 20% Evergreen coupon in the bottom left of the screen it's being bought on sale and sales Cycles repeat themselves as well so there are certain examples of certain products that are only good when a website has a certain
discount going on luckily Memorial Day Father's Day 4th of July July Prime day October Prime day early Black Friday Black Friday Cyber Monday Christmas sales a lot of these deals repeat themselves and the better organized leads you can have in your sell amp spreadsheets the better you can do so make sure that if you're spending all this time doing product research you're maximizing the lifetime value of your leads using the keepa tracking alerts feature which is included with your keepa subscription and the seller Google
Sheets feature which is included with your salary subscription you just one click export put as good notes of as possible and before you know it you'll have tons of examples when different deals are going you know what to go ahead and buy and you're getting emails from keepa saying new items have become good time to make money on them and you already know exactly how to discount those items to where they become good using your seller M Google Sheets database right here there's a lot of cool customizations you can do on your
sellam Google Sheets as well but to start out just nice and basic out of stock almost good any favorite retailers you have back to school Q4 really really important that you guys take advantage of the keyo tracking alerts we had aell on our buy box fanit podcast who said he had like 1,500 ke alerts said which is absolutely Bonkers a good amount of his business for the entire year is just waiting for those items to become good and snagging them with every and coupons that's a beautiful thing that's what you
should be working towards if you're a beginner seller make sure you're using keep alerts and your seller M Google Sheets to think long term and make sure your knowledge and efforts compounding like crazy now we're going to be digging into the calendar for the year because not every day is created equal and certain times of the year are easier than other ones depending on when you're watching this video we might be right before right after one of these big opportunities and I just want to give
you guys a sense of some important dates for Amazon sellers and what you should really be doing during these times and best practices there's also going to be specific segments later in the course on Q4 and back to school as well cuz those are two of the best times of the year and I want to make sure you guys are fully prepared so starting off in q1 which is January to March this is definitely the slow time during the year but this is also a really good time to get started regardless of when you're watching this video it makes sense to
get started if you're a complete beginner that's the only way you're going to see results the major Milestone of January is going to be Retail Arbitrage clearance season as well as the kind of layover from Q4 in terms of finishing up some stuff Q4 is really really easy January and February are harder than Q4 but there's definitely some layover in terms of like customer spending gift cards they got for Christmas and some excess demand as well as lots of winter prodcts are popping off during January February is more of
the same there's not going to be a ton of stuff going on between January and March that are really Landmark significant there are going to be Valentine's Day sales which are really helpful anytime major holidays happening there's going to be different deals going on and President's Day I believe is in February as well and for some reason this year was really really good too so President's day as well is a very good sourcing day March is great for St Patrick's Day sales as well and then
Easter depending on year I think Easter was actually in March this year but either way you guys get the idea getting into Q2 in April Easter's going to be a great time as well as as the winter is getting warmer there's going to be lots of good additional opportunity too May is when things start to get fun we start off with Mother's Day and then there's also Memorial Day at the end of the month and this is overall when the American consumers typically starts to pick up their spending again compared to
January to March so Mother's Day is really good there's a lot of deals coming up as well as Memorial Day is going to be really good as well and this is where we really start to get into the easier part of the Year June is going to have you obviously selling through the inventory that you bought during Memorial Day some retailers will have like summer kickoff sales it's going to be on a retailer by retailer basis you're going to want to have that burner email address like we talked about so you can consistently get fed deals
you're going to want to have that burner email address like we talked about so you can consistently get fed deals from all these different websites and then July is when things really start to get fun it's when back to school starts to see demand increase in late June and early July and there's a full back to school section later in the course like I said but the Fourth of July is going to be a ton of really good deals then like a week after the Fourth of July typically Amazon does a prime day which
is really good to sell your inventory on Amazon you see increased demand increased price action during this decreased competition but also a ton of retailers run deals to compete with Amazon Prime there's a ton of good sourcing as well which is right after the 4th of July by mid July demand is really kicked off for back to school and crayons and backpacks and all different types of products like that really start to pop off another really good thing that happens in Late July is sales tax holidays which are really helpful as
well make sure to look up if your specific state has a sales tax holiday as well because it might be a good opportunity to get products cheaper and avoid sales tax for that time frame getting into August we're getting into the peak of back to school there's also those sales tax holidays like I mentioned depending on state there's some good Retail Arbitrage hidden in secret clearance during this time as well and fall Sports really popping off which sees volleyball Gear soccer gear and everything like that kicking off
September is going to be Labor Day and fall Sports season pretty straightforward during this time frame October typically there's another Prime day at least there was in 2023 so there's a ton of competitor sales it's also when we get into Q4 and tons of different progs slowly start to really pick up in demand however during November when early black Friday sales kickoff and then later Black Friday Thanksgiving Cyber Monday a ton of good sourcing then and that's when we really start to get into the really really best
part of the year the Black Friday Cyber Monday Rush is when you buy a bunch of inventory and then in my opinion the best practice should be to immediately fbm those prods as well December is the peak of Q4 between December 1st and December 20th it's also when you see the main holiday Rush the best days of the year tily are around December 10th and the 12th however it's all going to be dependent on your inventory quality between December 15th and 20th is basically like the last Rush of Christmas orders and then demand
typically slows down a little bit post Christmas a ton of customers do get gift cards for Christmas though like I mentioned and that can prove some increased demand but by this point you're going to be tapering off your fbm for the year if you're doing a lot of fbm which I'm a big fan of and then switching back to mainly going to be FBA and that's the sourcing calendar for the entire year guys it's really important to understand not every day is created equal and depending on when you start
you might need to be a little bit more patient for the time to get better however you always are going to be able to get major Sals if you're doing it during a good time make sure to mark your calendars and be prepared to Source heavy so now that we know the calendar for the entire year what products actually sell best so I just want to make it very clear guys all different types of products sell really well on Amazon and as an Amazon Seller it makes sense to have a diversified catalog of different products cu the Market's ebing
and flowing throughout the year in this video I want to break down the pros and cons of some of the different favorite niches that people sell but you got to understand if you can see other sellers selling the product there's a very good chance they're making money on it and that it's reseller friendly and there's a good chance as an Amazon Seller you're going to have all different types of products in your store at one time I'm going to break down the pros and cons of a bunch of the popular different niches
and give you guys my opinion on them the first Niche is going to be the beauty Niche so Beauty progs the nice thing about them they're really high volume women love buying them year round they tend to be pretty Evergreen Beauty progs aren't really dominated by any specific brand the way you guys will see some other niches are which can make it a little bit hard to decipher which are res seller friendly and which aren't and that's going to be using your best judgment looking at if other resellers
are selling that product and that's why I'm a big fan of the storefront stalking model CU there are going to be a lot of private label products or Amazon dominated ones that you're not going to be able to sell as a seller but that comes from you checking in advance and deciphering whether or not the brand is dominating something or if you can see other sellers making money on that product another thing that can be a little bit difficult on top of there not being any main brand specifically for beauty at least in my opinion is going
to be how the average sale price is a little bit lower one of the main bottlenecks for an online Arbitrage business is typically going to be order cancels and actually getting enough quality of product and at the lower asps average sale price of beauty products it can be a little bit difficult to scale major pros of the beauty Niche is it is a little bit more simple to Source Products don't really have variations and a lot of these brands are smaller Brands so they pretty much only come from the brand website specifically
which make the process a lot easier as well if you already know where the inventory is coming from then it just comes to store fromont stocking or manual sourcing to find a couple good listings and using the coupon methods we're going to talk about in the free course will make your life a lot easier with that as well cuz remember guys you don't find products profitable you make them profitable beauty products are great cuz people don't really return them they can be a little bit hard due to wholesale competition and the lower
average sale price but they're definitely good products to sell if you can find them profitable of course the second Niche is going to be shoes and clothing this is my favorite personal Niche for beginners there are some big brands that you can see lots of people making money on just some examples of Brands I've personally sold Nike Adidas New Balance Jordan Kuma Under Armour Converse Etc these Brands don't tend to have wholesale competition which makes them a little bit easier to Source compared to other types of products like
grocery for example there's a lot of good Retail Arbitrage and online Arbitrage for these types of products like I said there's no wholesale though which makes it easier for the new seller these brands are also really big so they're carried on tons of different websites at one time which means there's a higher chance a certain item can be profitable at one point which makes it a little bit more complicated to Source but also makes it a lot easier to actually find that impr profitable because they can be carried on tons of
different websites at one point a major con of the shoes and clothing Niche is these products do get return way more than like Beauty Supplies or pet supplies or groceries for example so you do need to factor in some extra Roi especially for shoe types of prodcts luckily though these types of products also get really good cash back typically in terms of suppliers that sell this stuff which can make the process a little bit easier so shoes and cloth Beauty both good niches toys this is one of the most sexy categories that lots of
beginners want to sell cuz they sell crazy quick especially during the fourth quarter the problem with toys is demand is very seasonal and new movies and new lines of toys are coming out all the time so certain ones are getting retired and they might not be able to be sourced at all cuz they got retired a while ago however toys can be a little seasonal and a lot of the demand is concentrated towards the fourth quarter of the year which can make them hard to Source year round although you shouldn't say no to
him if you do find him year round another problem with the toyish is that am Amazon sells a lot of the brands themselves and it can be hard to compete with Amazon like I've said guys there's really no formula in terms of Amazon shareing the buy box versus not share in the buy box it's just listing by listing and a lot of stuff Amazon will actually go out of stock in each Q4 and then the price will absolutely go to the Moon which there is some good Arbitrage in Amazon Amazon flips I'm just not
personally educated on it I've always done traditional online Arbitrage just buying from retail sites like Cole's Walmart and Target toy products are going to get returned more than like Beauty and grocery adem but not more than shoes and stuff like that another Niche that's really cool is seasonal products if you go back a couple years ago and take a look at the keba charts on pools pools absolutely popped off during what happened in 2020 and 2021 the sales ranks are way down the prices are way up and seasonal progs can
provide you tons of good opportunities and literally year round they happen during winter winter procs pop off during summer summer stuff pops off during back to school backpacks and sporting goods and stuff like that will pop off and it's important to note that as a seller you're going to be very fluid you're going to adjust as the market changes and that might be selling certain products only certain times of the year and short-term thinkers will say oh no those products aren't very replenishable but they are replenishable
on a long enough time scale and you can sell soccer products every fall winter products every winter toys a Q4 so on and so forth and as you evolve and get better at a seller you're going to be way better at product research than you are now which makes sense and your output per hour of sourcing is going to go way higher you're going to have good seller amp spreadsheets to different leads and your ability is really going to a compound over time so seasonal prods it's not really a specific certain
type of niche in terms like return rate wholesale competition Etc however if you see different trends like Stanley Cups a couple years ago or pools during what happened a couple years ago it can make a lot of sense to pounce on this stuff especially during Q4 back to school when demand increases and if you see other sellers merch and fulfilling a product you can hop on that quick to merch field and potentially make some quick cash grocery products this is another really hot Niche the problem with grocery products is there's not much online
Arbitrage for it because they're so heavy and grocery products can also have expiration dates and customers as a whole don't really buy grocery products for shipping online partially just due to how heavy they are partially du to expiration dates another problem with the grocery need is there is a lot of wholesale competition so if you're looking to do Amazon Wholesale grocery is a phenomenal option for that however there's not going to be a lot of opportunities specifically on the online Arbitrage side things definitely for
Retail Arbitrage at grocery allet or Ali specifically and wholesale but not as much OA just just due to how heavy the products are however a lot of grocery products actually can't even be returned which is really awesome and if you need to get ungated in grocery you can just go to any website like Target find a grocery category product and that's going to ungate for you another popular Niche is electronics this can be good for ra OA and wholesale it's not going to be dominated specifically by any
Brands there are going to be higher return rates for this types of products however there is going to be absolutely insane demand especially during Q before and like back to school like calculators for example are going to fit into that Niche so there is going to be a lot of good opportunity I know people who actually kill with electronics I don't really have much experience with it though pet supplies is pretty similar to grocery in a sense that they're really really heavy there's not going to be a
lot of opportunity for online Arbitrage with pet splies as much I would say more so than grocery though there is going to be a lot of good Retail Arbitrage and wholesale opportunity specifically for pet splies though you can onate using like Petco or petmart or chewy for example and the last Niche we're going to talk about is sporting goods Sporting Goods are absolutely popping especially during whatever season's going on like for example we're filming this in the spring and summer baseball stuff before
we know it football gear volleyball Gear soccer gear is going to be popping off it's pretty similar to shoes and clothing and that it tends to be dominated by certain brands which can be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it I love Sporting Goods especially during back to school in Q4 you only need to ungate a couple Brands to really hit it hard prods are going to get returned more than average though need to fact that in on your sourcing truth be told though you're going to sell all different types
of products in your Amazon store at one point customers aren't looking at everything you got they're just buy whatever's in the buy box honestly so we're very lucky as sellers we can sell all different types of products even fbm and FBA at the same time on certain products or FBA some stuff fbm some stuff at the end of the day we're not buying products we're buying data and metrics based on past sales history for all this stuff guys so that's the pros and cons of different niches
so just showed you guys how to do online Arbitrage now I want to jump in and do a full tutorial on how to do Retail Arbitrage which is buying product in store as well so we're here at Marshalls we're going to show you guys everything you need to know to get started with Retail Arbitrage the nice thing is pretty much all you guys watching this have stores like Marshalls TJ Maxx the Nike out Grocery Outlet alies nearby there's profle procs you just got to get in there and find out obviously you guys
have seen me mainly talk about online Arch throughout the free course going on kohs and Walmart and finding products Retail Arbitrage is great too which is actually coming into the store and scanning stuff just want to go through some pros and cons of Retail Arbitrage versus online Arbitrage to start the pros of Retail Arbitrage is it's a lot easier to understand you guys saw a lot of online Arbitrage was coupons and discount code and discount gift cards and stuff like that which totally works for Retail Arbitrage as well you just
need it a lot less it tends to be a lot more cut and dry in terms of like the price just being the price you give it a scan you see if it's profitable another nice thing about Retail Arbitrage is you don't need to wait for the product to actually arrive to you you can walk into your local Marshals today scan stuff and get it listed today Merchant field or ship it off to Amazon FBA today the cons are that it's a little bit more work the cool thing is you don't have to stick to just one you can do both so even though
Retail Arbitrage is a little bit more work tends to be harder to get scale of different prodct they're not going to have like 100 to one thing here that's a main benefit of online Arbitrage the profit margins tend to be a little bit higher as well cuz there's less competition and you can get going quicker you don't even need to have your Amazon seller account open to get a free trial of seller amp and start scanning stuff literally this week it's actually pretty similar to online arbit charage
in terms of how to tell if something's good so all we need to do is take the seller an mobile app right here and then scan the barcode we can see this one specifically didn't scan like another Nike thing right here we'll give this a scan okay this guy didn't pop up either sometimes the barcodes won't match let's see right here boom yeah here we go like now we see the basic data on this product like it's going for 15 here right MSR piece 40 bucks right and then we just plug it in on sell amp and we see buying for 15
sells for 33 on Amazon about $6 profit a piece however the sales rank is a little bit higher on this so even though the sales rank's high now we want to go ahead and scroll down and take a look at the Kea chart on sell amp and we can see this actually does sell pretty well considering the offer count otherwise known as the competition has gone nicely so the cellerant mobile app is included in that same subscription you pay to get the Chrome extension and the web app it's all inone and that's what you're
going to use to go in stores and scan so getting started with Retail Arbitrage all you need is sell it so it's actually a little bit less expensive than getting started with all in Arbitrage and it takes less time CU you can go to your local stores and start scanic stuff today in terms of what you want to scan with ril Arbitrage it's going to be pretty similar to online Arbitrage and it's just going to be like big name brand stuff so like Nike Adidas Under Armour whatever you see people selling with all Arbitrage and storefront
stalking you're going to learn new brands to potentially look for and now as you're doing Retail Arbitrage it might seem like there's tons of stuff to scan but you're going to primarily zero in on the same Brands you're doing online Arbitrage with then you can see some stuff will just be really really cheap here like we can see these These are six bucks let's give these again yes six bucks right there let's see retailing at 12 actually seems like a pretty good deal here yeah so six bucks
uh six bucks here just plug that in $1 profit so that's not good however we're going to scroll down here and see if this has been good in the past we take a look at the last year yeah there's totally been times when this was good guys so 23 24 here we can see if it goes back up there it becomes really good but obviously we're only going to focus on quick flips so I'm not going to worry about this for now so this listing is interesting CU I actually know that there's a listing I found from these
with all Arbitrage however scanning the barcode didn't provide any results so I manually looked it up here right so we can go ahead and see if something doesn't show up or if you think you saw a listing in the past huge benefit of doing online Arbitrage and Retail Arbitrage at the same time we can see $599 here right boom Going for 20 six bucks profit 100% r y this is absolutely a winning prodct here because we can see even though the rank's high if we take a look down here at the keepa we can see
this is totally moved so sales rank can be totally misleading and that a big red flag could be the sales rank being too high but you need to take a look at the keepa chart and see if it's actually moving because if it is like this product it can still be good to test in terms of product research criteria it's pretty similar to alline Arbitrage cool thing thing about Retail Arbitrage is the profit margins tend to be a little bit higher so you can set your criteria like you know 40% R wi minimum I even
know people who do Retail Arbitrage who don't buy anything below like a 50 or 60% Ry you just need to make sure it actually sells which comes from use and seller and take a look at the charts and all the data yeah sometimes you run in like I have obviously no idea what this brand is but easy thing is we can find the data really quick and that's the nice thing with Retail Arbitrage is you can get reps in so quick like you can figure out if a Brand's good really quick and then you know you want to go
ahead and pursue more of it let's see oh yeah we got no barcode on this guy that's a shame even though it's a DS see what other name brand stuff we got here let's see more Adidas this guy got a barcode too does not damn that sucks let's see Nike right here yeah $22 MSRP it's going for 13 bucks there could totally be some money there ah so yeah here we go so pan 13 this is actually pretty close to being profitable the pr problem the sales rank is so high right there it's 9 million so we're going to pass on that
that's the thing with Retail Arbitrage guys you literally just got to scan and get reps in as much as possible and you're going to find stuff right best stores in my opinion Nike outlet Adidas outlet Under Armour outlet Rack Room Shoes Kohl's Marshalls TJ Maxx stuff like that anywhere they got discounted products not as big a fan of like Costco and Sam's Club and stuff like that cuz those technically are wholesalers so people are buying that cheaper nice thing of stores like this with just discounted name brand prox people aren't
really wholesale it's a lot more of an even playing field $46 for this MSRP here nothing popped up it's only going for 17 let's let's let's manually type this in sometimes I'll do that as I'll uh manually type it in Nike blue men's t-shirt see if anything pops up here Nike swim okay we'll add that into the title swim here okay yeah not seeing any result that uh yields right there no problem we'll keep moving oh this yeah there's some variations that are similar but none of this is the
uh none of these are the same thing right here and that's a 3XL terms of what size is sell best it's all about what shows on the keepa chart you know in selling amp data there's like a couple of these that are look good for typin here yeah okay here we go o neat okay check this out yeah yeah here we go guys so this is an 82k rank there's currently no one selling this product it's we're buying it for 17 so I just have to think to myself do I think these could sell for like 40 I totally do
however I don't have to just think to myself I can go ahead down here and take a look at what this has sold for in the past and we can see when this is sold it's been around like yeah 38 40 in the buy box so at 40 here we're making 12 bucks pop and we got no competition that's the beauty of Retail Arbitrage is I could hop in the buy box for this thing today on four units at a really really good Roi and I have proof that this sells considering there's there's been sellers in the past but there's
currently none and the offer Down's gone up and down love to see that that's a Retail Arbitrage W oh this is interesting so we scanned some socks and some leggings popped up here so not all the time will the barcodes match and that's the nice thing about doing this a lot is you eventually kind of realize what you need to pay for different products and that's why if you only go to a store once you can't judge a book by its cover and only go once you got to go a bunch because eventually you know
the employees and you know what to look for and it makes the process a lot easier I can't underst understand enough the benefits of the speed component of Retail Arbitrage and not needing to wait for a product to get to you from alll TR and you literally just list it same day when you're a complete beginner it's so helpful to get that extra time back and learn a lot quicker and make money quicker if the listings are actually moving ah yeah here we go okay let's see so I manually type these in we can see
15 bucks right here let's see yeah we got yeah a whole bunch of units here and we're paying uh 15 selling at 31 50k rank here six bucks profit a piece 38% r y after shipping sales tax and everything so that's like 50 bucks profit hanging out right there and so what I'm going to do is if I found that good I might drive around some of the other Marshals or some of the other Ross see if they got some too that's a beautiful thing yeah definitely okay we see we got six units right here paying
$14.99 look at that literally same exact item right there just quarter socks right there buying for 15 buy boxing at 34 six bucks profit fbm friendly too we can see there's people fbm in that love to see that that is easy 30 bucks profit hell of a lot more fun than clocking into the job I can tell you that much occasionally we got some toys some Electronics you don't know how good it is until you scan it we can see this is seven bucks now it's selling for seven on Amazon so we would lose $2 a piece so
that is five $5 piece that doesn't fit in the business model unfortunately buying for 20 selling for 27 do not like that and if you don't recognize a brand like the nice thing is you can quickly validate by just giving a quick scan and seeing for other people selling it and if it's profitable might be worth a test if the data looks good we got a ton of stuff here yeah like nice thing is with btic SCH in Q4 when demand really really picks up on stuff and it's even better to do retail arbitr and get it listed
fbm quick cuz during those big seasonal opportunities more listings than ever are Merchant fulfilled friendly so you can buy and list same day some people even as they're shopping in the store sometimes they'll even sell while they're still in the store see eight bucks here going for 16 oo okay let's see ah eight bucks into 17 yes just about Break Even on these um yeah eight bucks here let's see have these been profitable in the past though see it sometimes it can take a little bit to load on the Wi-Fi here we can see not
really honestly a little bit of buy box history up at 18 going take a look you knew the merchant fulfilled calculator on sell amp here this is probably going to ship for like four bucks yeah so buy for eight $2.50 profit 30% r y I don't love that personally it's like dog food do I have any idea if this dog food is a reseller friendly brand I have no idea but all you can do is give it a scan and find out $7 here seven bucks into 14 so we would lose 57 cents a pop there so yeah CR Proctor search C here seven
bucks no see we'll cover it up here another question I get asked all the time is specifically around shoes that stores like Marshalls and Ross if it doesn't have the box unfortunately pass on it because you have to have the full box with the Box L to sell the products on Amazon otherwise you'll have some unhappy customers and at the end of the day guys it's literally all just data like it's all just about what the data says like don't get emotional about certain products it's all purely just
Based on data another insanely helpful tip for Retail Arbitrage two of them actually one is getting to know the employees well and making their life easier if you have a huge opportunity to make money with with Retail Arbitrage bring them a Starbucks gift card you know make their life easier leave the stores nicer than you came you know keep things tidy and everything and if you take care of them they'll take care of you and let you know when deals are starting and let you know what's new or let you know if
someone just clean out a big Hall if there's new markdowns and another crazy thing that went down after what happened in 2020 and 2021 is a lot of web it specifically not like a Marshalls for example but like a Kohl's for example added buy online pickup in store Dick Sporting Good is another great example of that and that is an insane hack because you can Source online pick up the items in store and a really big Pro tip for those of you guys this deep in the free course is you can actually go online and filter on most sites to what
your local store has in stock Place pickup orders and then once they confirm the pickup order list the items fbm potentially as well all right so we got the knockoff Stanley Cups here so uh see oh no no wonder yeah Stanley Cups were like 70 bucks at the peak during Q4 2022 absolute movie I have a feeling these will have absolutely no value on Amazon all right well I stand corrected uh they're actually profitable I'm assuming this is yeah Hydra beak okay all right well now I look like a little bit of a
bozo nine bucks here five bucks profit now five sellers here good sales rank we just need to make sure the keepo chart looks good which we can see really stable here so I kind of assume the brand probably sells it themselves let's see if the Brand's on here uh oh it's uh looks like a couple big wholesalers with a ton of reviews this is something I need to look a little bit more deep into in terms of if other SKS are selling as well but this actually definitely is profitable another really good Pro tip when you're doing Retail
Arbitrage is bundles especially if for doing like grocery allet or Allies if you scan a barcode of a product it's typically a single pack and if it's close or it's profitable always go on sell amp and manually type in the name of it with like two pack or just the name of the product and see if you can find any bundle listings like grocery two pack here for example obviously the product's not just titled grocery but you can literally just search that here and it's going to pop up additional
results and let you know if there's other stuff to potentially look to massive massive Pro tip that other people are don't doing there's a ton of money in bundles two packs three packs four packs Etc another question I get all the time is should you compete with Amazon on different listings it's tough because Amazon shares the buy BLX on some listings and doesn't share the buybox on other listings so you need to get comfortable using the buy box analysis feature on seller amp to see if Amazon's sharing the buy box enough like
I'll show you look at the buy box Distribution on one of these here so we go here for example what are we paying 26 oh this is actually really really profitable here the problem is there's only one seller so if we scroll down to the buy boox analysis here we can see the buybox is never being shared so if you see Amazon a listing you need to scroll down here and see how much of the buybox share Amazon's actually given up and then look at the keepa chart and make sure you can see the bottom chart the offer count going up and down to
show that other sellers are getting sales 10 bucks yeah yeah beauty stuff tends to be really profitable people don't really return it ever the problem is typically they'll only have a couple of stuff right but when you're a beginner that might be all you need if you're on limited budget the way I was when I was getting started oh nine bucks here yeah check this out so this is this is Prof player the problem is there's only one seller and it's Amazon so that's private label we're not going to
worry about that because we're not going to get any buy BLX sh if we even if we did list it we might get an IP complaint and it's just a game of getting as many scans in as possible guys and getting as many reps and you get to learn really really quick see yeah six bucks selling for 14 definitely not liking that this is just a little product here see oh someone I think someone stole this they hate to see that yeah that's not good see anything with the red clearance tag is always a a green flag that it might
be good cuz it meant they recently marked it down more now sometimes they'll cover up the barcode ear which can make it harder to scan you either got to pass on that or manually type in the name of it on S we're obviously just you know showing you guys example examples of what stuff looks like but I've had like some crazy hauls from the Nike out and the Adidas outlet over the years ton of money in Retail Arbitrage and it's just a lot more simple to understand than all Arbitrage because it typically doesn't require a bunch of
fancy discounting so totally do both and then over time we're going get really good at both nine bucks here yeah so we can see a dollar profit on that definitely not good enough here however the buy box was typically 23 on this which makes this yeah three bucks profit and this actually sells pretty quick too so that actually is an example of a winning prod so don't sleep on Retail Arbitrage guys there's tons of stuff to get out here and scan it's a little bit easier to get started with than online Arbitrage you
can totally do both I get asked all the time which is better for a beginner ra or OA and the answer is do both some people the longer they've been in it they do both forever some people love Retail Arbitrage they have a couple really good relationships with managers or some people have a couple websites they really like to hit heavily with OA and at the end of the day all we're doing is finding discounted name branded products and flipping them on Amazon all right guys welcome to section four which is going to be all things backend
tracking shipping everything like that by the end of this module you're going to know everything you need on how you're going to track the back into your Amazon business sending FBA shipments fulfilling fbm orders managing everything managing your account Health all that stuff right here the place I want to start is tracking your online Arbitrage or Retail Arbitrage purchase cuz that's going to be the first step is getting products I'd recommend initially just doing that via Google Sheets pretty
similar to how you'll be using the seller and Google Sheets feature you do want to get comfortable with basic formulas within Google Sheets you might need to watch some YouTube videos on getting going with that that's an our way of knowing how to do basic multiplication addition basic formulas within Google Sheets here however you'll be placing lots of orders on big retail websites as you do online Arbitrage you want to make sure you track that stuff nicely so that you know the status of your inventory what's received what's
ordered everything like that say we go ahead and take a look and buy these black and gold AI Sage slides for example we want to have a good spreadsheet that details all of our purchases all of our as in case of any potential account health issues we need to provide documentation for it's why we need to have this asent column and then know the order number to type in the order number on our email right there that's easy to beat but you do want to have good organization so you can see it here so I'm going to show you guys how I
set up my own spreadsheet so we can adequately track all our online Arbitrage orders we can see these slides right here black and gold buy boxing at 21 what I initially want to do is copy and paste this as over here I'm going to plug that in right item I like putting the item like however you think about that item you do have the as if you ever do need to formally sech it's like black gold uh you know Adidas AI Sage slides for example this one we probably want to spread out a little bit more right here
and then say the total cost was like 10 bucks a unit and we bought 15 units it was like or 150 bucks for example quick math right there so units 10 right and then we want to go here and put the cost per unit and divide that right there then we want to make these ones money signs right here right so this is a basic you know track you want to do card use Capital One spark that's my favorite one and then I like this status the color coding right here so like for example say we had two orders of these we could copy copy the same thing right
here the order numbers would obviously be different right here so if we plug these guys in oops right there so now we can see say one of them came in one day before they Shi quicker whatever this is what your spreadsheet would look like basically just detailing the order number the Asin what item it was your total cost per unit the total cost of the purchase what credit card you use the status your prep Center would have a specific Google Sheets template they would probably give you if they have a good prep Center so you go ahead and
check this or some of them have in-house softare here as well I'd recommend just using this basic template in terms of your OA order tracking to get started with over time you might make it a little bit more complicated as you find key data points or just ways your brain works better this is a good place to start in terms of tracking your orders for online Arbitrage though you guys just saw my system for tracking all your purchases with online and Retail Arbitrage it's really important that you keep that
documentation correctly especially the correlation of the column of the Asin with the corresponding order number that way if you ever have documentation needed for authenticity complaints or IP complaints you have what documentation is necessary to deal with those effectively and give Amazon what they need to prove that you're you're actually buying authentic products now don't freak out if you get some inauthentic complaints you'll get about one per every like one to a couple thousand orders basically so it's not
super often but the key is that if you're doing all- in Arbitrage you're selling legit products you have that documentation and say you do get an inauthentic complaint for an indid this product all you need to do is pull the as command F on that Google Sheets or search that Google Sheets for that specific Asin now you automatically have all the corresponding order numbers very similar to how you get ungated you just download those emails as PDFs put them in one combined PDF together using a PDF combiner from Google and submit that
documentation to Amazon once again similar to an ungate it's probably going to take a couple of submissions that's completely normal and that's why it's so important to be tracking the stuff correctly so that inevitably when you do get some inauthentic complaints from unhappy customers you can go ahead and beat them nice and easy and don't have to worry about account health issues on Zar Central if one of those complaints stick does stick around and you don't take the time to beat it it probably
won't be a major issue but it could be if you're a newer seller so I'm definitely going to recommend going through the process and really trying to beat those every single time all right quick tutorial on shipping supplies you're going to need you'll see a lot of these mentioned when we show you guys in like the fbm section of fulfilling fbm orders and FBA and creating FBA shipment specifically I do want to give a dedicated section just to show you everything you are going to need right off the bat really easy
you're going to need tape and a tape gun you can get that at Walmart this is special tape from Uline however that's nice and easy these are going to be FN SKU labels if you want to get a label printer from the ge-o you're going to use these FN SKU otherwise known as FN SK labels you can buy these on Amazon if you're not going to use a label printer you can get 30 up label paper at Walmart that's how you'll be able to print out these FBA labels which is what I got started doing the FN
ski labels are what you're going to put on the barcode or the outside of the poly bag when you're shipping product outs like for example say we're selling this book this is a phenomenal book by the way we would print it out from our printer and then we go ahead and slap the label over the barcode right here would have the specific information of the product so the Amazon employes can go ahead and process that so you want to have fnc labels if you're going to get a label printer from the ge-o otherwise 30
up label paper for FBA stuff you don't need these if you're just going to do fbm for FBA you are going to need either 30 up label paper on the old school printer or FN skq labels for the new school printer you can also get the 4x6 labels which will go in here these going to be for both FBA and fbm shipping label directly for fbm orders don't worry about the packing slip for fbm orders you don't really need to put that on and then you're going to have both the shipping label and the Amazon
specific label for FBA that you're going to put on both boxes in terms of printer I got started out just using the old school printer in my College library if you have a little bit more of a budget I'd recommend getting a Rolo or Pono colon is a little bit cheaper I think um these are really helpful it just make your life a lot easier specifically right there you're need some scissors as well a lot of people talk about using like the scraper things to get off like retail taxs I'll typically just cover it
with the blank F and skew label I think that's a lot more efficient specifically for FBA products I'd recommend just looking up like a value pack on Amazon of a bunch of different sizes just make sure it does have the Suffocation warning on it you can look up like Amazon FBA poly bags and a bunch of stuff's going to pop up and then longterm you're going to figure out which ones you specifically need for fbm poly bags I like 9 by 12 and 12 X5 occasionally you're going to need 19x 24 as well and then for boxes for merchant
fulfilled orders if you want to do some of those start out just getting them from Walmart or Uline eventually you'll probably buy the exact size you need for the types of products you like to sell both from Uline to start out you can just get Walmart ones as well if you had a bunch of fbm or spill you would figure it out and go to Walmart and get stuff so don't sleep on shipping supplies this is what you need to get started and then you are going to need bulk boxes for FBA the nice thing is if you're primarily
doing online Arbitrage you can just reuse your boxes that you get from the products that are shipping and bul to you from the suppliers that's a great way to save money boxes from Walmart and Home Depot are great too just make sure you stay under 50 lbs total and make sure you stay under 25 Ines total as well you see these are believe 24 here so this is very convenient uh shout out Home Depot Walmart ones are good too but you can use pretty much any box to send in prox and bulk to Amazon for fbm ERS it's really important that you do
unbranded boxes as well so the customers don't think you're Drop Shipping nice and easy guys don't overthink shipping flies let's jump into comparing fbm and FBA with the full Merchant field walk there one thing that was incredibly helpful for me in my Amazon Seller Journey that's a little bit unique compared to the way most people teach Amazon FBA was utilizing Merchant filled so Merchant filled is sending items directly to the customer instead of sending them off in bulk Amazon FBA down
kind of everything you need to know about Merchant fulfilled the upsides the downsides comparing it to FBA the shipping costs and the shipping templates how much you should charge for shipping everything like that supplies you need to know so let's dig in this is a really really important section that you want to take notes on because if you can get sales as a merchant fulfilled seller initially it'll help you learn a lot quicker especially when you're a beginner so the big benefits of fbm is that you get faster cash flow so the
products can sell quicker because you don't have to wait for them to check into FBA there's also no FBA fees but you do pay individual shipping beginners ask me all the time is it better to fbm or FBA from a cost perspective when you FBA you pay FBA fees but you ship the product off in bulk so the shipping per units really really cheap when you fbm you don't pay FBA fees but you do pay individual fbm shipping costs which we're going to talk about in a little bit both of these are based on size and
weights end up being pretty much the same thing another benefit of fbm is that you can test lights you can buy you know just one or two of stuff that doesn't really make sense from a cost perspective specifically with FBA the downsides of fbm is that it takes more work and it's not possible on every listing right so for example if we take a look at this listing right here and we go ahead and see taking a look down here at the data and then buybox statistics on keepa we can see that all the sellers on this listing that are getting buybox
are FBA but if we take a look at this listing here and go to data and then buy box statistics we can see that taking a look at this FBA column here we can go ahead and click this twice and filter it we can see that you know 30 % plus of the buybox share here is going to sellers that don't have that FBA check mark so this is an fbm friendly listing and the data buyx statistics feature of keepa and just overall looking and seeing if other people are fbm a product is going to be key to identify if something's fbm friendly and not every
listing is fbm friendly but everything is FBA friendly because Amazon gives the buy box more to FBA sellers on a comparative basis right so fbm takes more work and it's not possible on every listing on listings you see other people getting bbox fbm it does make sense to test though typically uh the big benefits of FBA is it scales better better shipping in bulk you can also sell products at higher prices because the buybox algorithm favors FBA Sellers and stuff sells a lot quicker because the buybox algorithm favors FBA sellers
once the products are actually checked in the downsides of FBA are the checkin times can be more likely to price tank because of the checkin times as well if it's a lead that's easy to find as well as a little bit more lost inventory too which you definitely want to keep in mind now in terms of going ahead and calculating fbm costs this is a a massive mistake beginners make is they take a look here at the seller and profit calculator and think that this is the fbm numbers so then they think their profit just gets taken here because you
would have to add in like $4 shipping that's not the case what you need to do is you need to scroll down here and go ahead and where it says FBA here you want to toggle that to fbm right and say this was selling for like 20 bucks here right fbm we now have the fbm cost we need to enter so we need to go ahead up here and take a look at the weight and see this weighs 1.
45 o and then you want to go ahead and screenshot this then we can see that's probably going to ship for like four bucks here right so now we scroll back down and we put in that fbm cost here right so we can see buying for eight selling for 20 this was selling for 20 this would be nice and profitable the big mistake people make is they look at those FBA numbers without changing it right and then think they plug in that shipping then it's not actually profitable that's not the case so the big thing is you need to go up here take
a look at the weight and correlate that to the estimates here as I've released a bunch of fbms I've been doing recently it tends to be about here in terms of what this ends up being occasionally stuff's going to be a little bit more expensive and you want to consider buying shipping on pirate ship and then confirming shipping on Amazon for fbm order specifically you're going to buy whatever shipping is cheapest through Amazon 99% of the time under one pound typically going to B USPS and this comes
from my experience doing tens of thousands of fbm packages especially during Q4 above one pound is typically going to be UPS in in this price range however they have had some significantly cheap ones I've been getting some 2bs of like seven bucks lately which is super popping as well shipping templates is really really important this is something a lot of beginners overthink the way you get to shipping templates is you go to the top right on sour Central and hit the gear menu then drop down menu and hit shipping settings and then
you want to go ahead and update your shipping templates I'd recommend doing free shipping for standard and economy orders if you look at any listing with fbm sellers that's going to be prenominal what they're doing and then for next day Expediting the expensive shipping ones you want to update your templates to charge something along the lines like 2030 or $40 plus a dollar per pound that way you make extra profit for the extra work cuz typically especially if you're shipping stuff pretty quick
you're only going to have to actually pay like 15 or 20 bucks so if you're charging a lot you can get some extra profit on those orders as well big thing is knowing if you can fbm listing test it if the data buy box statistics looks good for like 72 hours or so fbm is best during back to school in Q4 or whenever specific listing is in season with competition going down and price going up and other sellers fbm in it finding fbm listings a great way to find fbm specific listings is using keep a product finder as well as storefront
stocking fbm SS on listings you can see that they're getting fbm buybox Sheron as well pricing listings price where the buy boxes go if you're FBA a listing with lots of fbm sellers price higher see if you can snag the buy Box share higher you're going to be changing your prices from time to time too occasionally fbm shipping will be be really expensive use pirate ship in that case in terms of supplies you need so you're going to want to have 9 by 12 12x5 and 19x 24 poly mailers from Amazon 4x8 bubble mailers from Amazon and 15x
12x10 unbranded boxes from Walmart or Uline a big Pro tip for getting buy Box share as an fbm so especially if for newer is using repricing software as well as being in zero day handling time which is another shipping settings that you can just hit in the gear meni top right shipping settings General shipping settings updated to zero day handling time that means you're required to send the product out sooner but it also gives you more buy Box share that's a good way to build some initial confidence and you
can switch back and forth like some people will even only go zero day handling time certain days of the week just with the way their work schedule and stuff like that works it's really worth it to put in that extra work though for that extra buybox share because you get a lot of extra money and proof of concept can I do FBA and fbm at the same time on the same as absolutely that's a major hack especially for back to school in Q4 so you'll see a lot of people on the Internet only talk about selling products Amazon FBA however
coming from someone who's made $50,000 profit in one month specifically just with fbm and then another 30,000 profit in one month with FBA you just don't get the type of flexibility to list on multiple asens or sell products quicker Etc with fbm compared to what you get with FBA you just don't get that type of flexibility with FBA compared to what you get with fbm and there's a massive opportunity a lot of beginners are sleeping on so if you're seeing other people fbm in listing consider testing
it out fbm especially if you'll get the repricer set up your shipping template set up and your handling time setup correctly that's Merchant ffi 101 so now we're going to talk about how you actually list and ship products off to FBA I'm inside the Box home software right now which is our Amazon FBA listing software that makes the process significantly easier if you watch other tutorials on listing products through Amazon so essential it's incredibly confusing and annoying to actually do that process box them makes it a lot
easier and is substantially cheaper than other Amazon FBA listing softwares on the market and you can try completely free at box.com box.com and I'm going to show you guys how you actually create a shipment and the entire process specifically right here we're inside the box and softare we're actually going to list products and go through the entire process of listing and then eventually shipping the products off to Amazon FBA got my labels here to show you guys the entire process two so we can see we're
here in the create shipment of boxum immediately we can go ahead and name our shipment which is going to be free course test run right here this is obviously a test shipment but this is the exact same process we're going to do FBA boxum is going to be adding Amazon fbm listing as well So eventually you can just manage your whole thing through here you can do your ship from address which you can change if you ever need to we just have the boxum office as our test address currently in there shipping method we can do SPD small partial
delivery which is basically just little boxes or LTL less than a truckload if you're a big seller or plan on being a big seller in the future you're going to do less than truck load shipments which are basically like big pallets pretty much of product that tend to cut your shipping cost down specifically packing type I like to do case packed on my shipments specifically labeling preference you can do a couple different options you can do seller labels or Amazon labels specifically same thing new case packed or individually right
there seller labels or Amazon labels specifically I recommend just doing seller labels and labeling them yourself with the FN SKU labels right here so we can go ahead and do seller labels and then Box contents right here you have a couple different options in terms of boxing provided no Box contents which then Amazon charges you a little bit of a fee or you can do 2D barcodes 2D barcodes were previously a very expensive and kind of confusing thing for a lot of new sellers it the other softwares that offer Tod barcodes are
way more expensive than box them we make it very accessible for you guys so I'm going to always use 2D barcodes because that makes it way easier to actually create the shipment and Amazon doesn't necessarily say this but products tend to check in quicker when you use 2D barcodes too and if you consider you know how affordable box and that you can try it for free and the progs tend to check in quicker it's a lot more easy to list progs the boxing tends to make a lot of sense to TD bar codes from the
ge-o so another nice thing about boxing we can see is you can actually print the FBA box labels as you prep your product so when you ship the FN SK labels you can print the FBA box labels as well as you go which previously what I did literally for years was I would have to write on each box like what was inside it and then print the FBA labels later which was really really annoying and super counterproductive basically so we let you print the FBA box labels that is a setting and then boxing does connect to your printer as well whichever type
of printer you use in these settings specifically so I personally like to have FBA box labels on as you prep and boxing specifically right there autofill list price is a great idea in general when you send products into FBA you do want to list them above the buy box to avoid price tanking typically when you send products into FBA you want to list your items above the FBA buybox price which makes it a lot easier to avoid price tanking and get sales higher so we can see within box and we can match a couple different highest FBA offer
lowest FBA offer buy box price and we can change the amount we automatically do that buy right here and then you can also do custom skew numbers to track your buy costs suppliers and everything which I'm going to show you guys in a sec right here so I like to personally have all three of those on and we can now go ahead here and create a shipment if you've ever used any other Amazon FB listing softwares it's really annoying to search different brands in here it takes a while for them to search box
them's incredibly quick if you compare that although listing software is I have an as we're going to go ahead and list right here so we can see boom create a new skew on this guy right here automatically we can see the details page of the product we can also see the offer specifically right here in terms of setting a different price we can see that's the FBA buy box specifically right there and then what we want to do is go ahead and do our list price which we can see is automatically 20% above the buy box right then we put in a buy
cost for whatever you paid for that product total quantity let's do 20 units quantity per case 20 supplier info we can go ahead and do oh yeah I typed that in wrong go ahead and do JC Penny right here select date purchase we can go ahead and do a couple days ago right here expiration dates if that was applicable and condition if you're doing used items you can do that as one we can see that custom skew automatically adds right there that shows our buy cost our list date as well as our supplier and the number generated at the end um which
is required by Amazon right because you're not really supposed to use the same skew right so we can go ahead and add product right here and now this is going to go ahead and transfer this data over to Amazon you could do multiple prods in the same shipment even multiple different prods in the same box if you wanted to even unique items to each other go ahead and click continue right here send this data off to Amazon now specifically it's going to take a sec to load there we go we can see shipment name shipment ID preparation and where
it's going not personally sure where V GT2 is in terms of Amazon warehouses all we need to do from there is go ahead and click confirm shipment right here now we're going to transfer this data off to Amazon boom go here now we're in step three this is personally my favorite part of box and it makes the process way easier on other listing softwares that also cost a lot more than box them you have to like create each box drag the procs over to each box really really annoying process on box them all you
have to do is hit bulk assign right here we can say five units per box four boxes total total unit count right here then add in our customizable Dimensions right here as well and our weight per box down the ounce if you want to and rather than do doing a bunch of dragon in different boxes all we have to do is put that in and then click save and print FBA box label right here and now we can see that box label opens up right there we could then print that or you could automatically print it using box some print in the settings which is really
really helpful too that'll print out the FBA box label specifically right there which we can go ahead and open up right here and now we can go ahead and see what that looks like for the different boxes right here and that beautiful beautiful 2D barcode right there makes the process a lot easier we can Al go ahead and print the FN SKU labels customizable amount right there that's going to be the ones that are going to go over the individual barcode on a product that is required for FBA but is not required for fbm you put it over the
label of the product over the suggested retail or if it's a product that's inside a poly bag you put it on the outside of the poly bag depending on what Amazon requires right now we can go ahead and print those FBA box labels once again if you ever needed to though it does automatically do it in the bulk assign now we you want to go ahead and hit continue right here this is going to take a sec to send that data off to Amazon right here and this is just basically a transferring over to Seller Central specifically other listing
softwares make it really confusing to actually print the shipping label through their software as well we don't it's really really easy through boxum interesting okay this Warehouse in Nevada typically it'll go a little bit close to you then we just hit accept shipping charges right here that purchases the label and now what we're going to be able to do is right when this loads here we can print out our shipping label Labs right here boom then you go ahead and print those out as well slap those on the sides of the box as
well with the FBA label right with the TD bar code right there then the actual shipment label as well makes it nice and easy right there we can also avoid the shipping charges like I'm going to do because obviously we don't need that cuz we're not actually sending the shipment but boxing makes it significantly easier to send the procs off to Amazon and Amazon s Central or inferior clunky more expensive listing tools that are already on the market specifically right there so if you guys are interested in boxum
you can try it completely free at boom.com and if you have any questions let me know we're going to be adding a lot more analytics merch fill listing features very soon so keep an eye on the boxum social media Pages as boxum evolves but right now you can get it substantially cheaper than other FBA listing tools in the market that cost a lot more haven't been updated in years and some don't even let you list new SKS on the platform specially so that's how boxing works so you guys know how to send Bo to
Amazon FBA in terms of fulfilling Merchant fulfilled orders all you have to do is put the item in the poly bag or box and then get the shipping label from Amazon to actually ship it out they say you need to include a packing slip I wouldn't really worry about that all you need to do is hit buy shipping on Amazon like we talked about in the fbm guide and then you get that shipping label slap it on the box and then ship it off don't overthink that guys it's really nice and easy eventually you'll
systematize it cuz hopefully you'll have dozens of fbm wars or maybe even hundreds of fpm Wars to fill every single today during back to school on Q4 all you need to do is buy shipping on Amazon s Central print out that label put the product in the poly bag or box then put that label in the Box there's no fnc labels required for fbm ORS so really all you need for fbm ORS is a printer labeles and then the poly bags or box to actually put the product into and then the product you're good to go don't overthink fulfilling fbm mors
guys welcome to section five of the free course guys in this section we're going to talk about the scaling process so how you actually delegate and grow your business and everything that goes into not just the basics of selling on Amazon the first main function of Delegation is going to be utilizing a prep Center prep centers are third-party Warehouse Services which will basically receive your inventory for you you'll send it directly from the retailer or supplier to the prep Center and then they'll send
it to Amazon for you with limited access to your seller account the big benefits of using a prep Center is that it saves you a bunch of time and it actually saves you money as well depending on the sales tax situation of your state you can get one in a sales tax free state like like New Hampshire Oregon Delaware or Montana or certain states that have sales tax for some stuff certain states that have no sales tax for some stuff like Minnesota Pennsylvania Rhode Island and New Jersey for example so not only do you save money not paying sales tax
but you also avoid the work labor cost supplies cost the warehouse cost Etc when does it makes sense to get a prep Center I'd say once you can send 500 units per month or day one if you're super serious ious and want to start Outsourcing your business from day one typical prep Center cost you want to Target like $150 to 80 per unit start with the goal of getting it down to around a dollar to like $130 per unit in bulk so how do they know what products you're sending and such all of them have a specific system for it typically it's
Google Sheets for inventory intake and they'll have some standard operating procedure to get set up with that as well as to get you set up with adding them as limited access to your seller account basically just to handle the shipment stuff prep centers just do FBA most of them just do FBA however some of them do fbm you'll just have to ask or check out like their website and such how do you find a prep Center in my opinion the best way kind of like anything is just going to be a referral from in the community from a friend or a
colleague right my buddy Chris Grant has a great list of prep centers on his website as well if you Google clear the Shelf prep Center list you'll see a big list of prep centers it's organized by state as well a big thing however is understanding when you're interviewing prep centers you're looking for a long partner you want someone you're going to work with for years therefore it's very important that you vet them correctly right so I'd recommend asking them a series of questions along these lines
right do do they sell on Amazon themselves right or do they have an experience selling on Amazon themselves it's really really important that they know the business and the industry and they're not just some random people who just got started with this and are you know trying to start this business you want people that have experience however they're selling on Amazon themselves currently that could provide some conflict of interest i' recommend being honest with them about any concerns you might have I've had prep centers in the
past where they have like policies and stuff around non-compete stuff I completely get that you want to know how long they've been in business you probably don't want someone that started a prep Center last month a big thing as well is going to be expected turnaround time you want to ask for that you want to Target 48 hour to 72-hour turnaround times is a bunch of inventory sitting dead at a prep Center while a bunch of new SS are hopping on it potentially and the price is going down this is a huge one how many clients do they have and
how close they are to capacity the last thing you want is an over preps Center that just signed on a ton of clients and they don't fit in their warehouse or they don't have enough employees or whatever so you want to make sure that they're honest with you about that and that's why once again it's so nice to get a referral within the community you also want to know who is your point of contact there if it's going to be the owner if it's going to be an employee depending on the size as well as what
system they use some prep centers use slack some use Discord some use like other Forum softwares as well do they do Returns on stuff like if a product's messed up are they going to help you hand the returns if a product comes in as the wrong product are they going to do the returns do they let you do on gating as well those are questions that like some prep centers will some prep centers won't it just depends on their policies as well do they do a flat per unit cost which typically is a massive green flag or do they do like special
based on like poly bags and all those little intricacies and such personally I would avoid ones that do like a lot of the fancy pricing and stuff you want people that are looking for long-term Partners same way you're looking for long-term partners and typically the people at flap per unit cost that aren't interested in like nickel and Diamond it's really helpful as well you want to know what if any shipment software they used to there's a couple different ones specifically out there as well as what
FBA Centers do their products typically go to personally I'm a biggest fan of prep centers in Delaware and New Hampshire because those are east coast East Coast is really good for buy Box share because it's close proximity wise to a good amount of the US population specifically prep centers I currently use are in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania Pennsylvania being sales taxfree in certain types of products specifically so that's really really convenient as well here and that's what allows me to live in Miami but run the
business completely remotely just with the prep Center managing everything for me in terms of I place an order fill out the Google sheet they have tell them how many units what I paid everything like that they intake the inventory for me and then their employees ship it off in bulk to the Amazon FBA warehouse for me that's probably the first main thing people delegate in terms of prep because obviously prepping doesn't make you any money sourcing makes you money this one sourcing is typically the last thing you
want to delegate in your business but getting outsourc prep is incredible helpful using a prep Center unlocks a ton of potential freedom I had so much less Freedom when I had my own Warehouse first getting started with the prep Center and I'd highly recommend once you can send like 500 units per month or from day one depending on your sales tax and just life situation look into getting set up with the prep Center however even if you have a prep center it's not necessarily cut and dry like you can't do any shipments yourself or
you can't do any fbms as well like even when I have a prep Center I'm still doing some fbms myself the occasional FBA shipment as well it's not C Dr but most of my stuff is through my prep centers now and I highly recommend looking into getting that setup as you scale your business along with prep centers being a super popular way to delegate to grow your Amazon this another really good way is to hire virtual assistants virtual assistants are basically employees overseas in countries like Morocco the
Philippines India and Pakistan where the US dollar goes crazy far big benefit of virtual assistance is they save you tons of time and they give you more time to grow the business and focus on higher leverage activities what task can I have virtual assistants do anything that's on the computer guys admin work product sourcing is a super popular on customer service po Sal supplier Outreach organization really anything on the computer and where do I find a good virtual assistant first of all you don't find a good virtual assistant you make a
good virtual assistant I love onlinejobs.ph specifically looking for long-term employees instead of gig places like Fiverr for example how do you avoid getting scammed by virtual assistants this is a really really big thing people want to make sure their virtual assistants aren't working for you know the same person people want to make sure their virtual assistant aren't working for two sellers or multiple sellers at one time or just getting their leads taken from a leads list a big thing you want to take a look at is
not giving away any personal info to the vas which should kind of come without saying but you'd be surprised how many people if you are giving them logins to seller amp accounts or keepo accounts make sure that you change the passwords and it's not a password or email you Ed for other stuff as well and basically to make sure that their leads aren't tanking that they're like double dipping and working for multiple sellers at one time align the incentives with profit share potentially long term you know if
you get good vas over long term you can align your incentives with profit share as well as the history feature of Sellar amp is really helpful you can go to seller.com check the history of your virtual assistant logged into seller amp and you can see the time stamps of the different products they're looking at and it's pretty easy to see if they're working you know an 8 hour shift and they're scanning six products that's pretty clear that they're just getting Le list from some of their homies over
in Pakistan or whatever and just sending them out to as many other Sellers as possible in terms of communication with your virtual assistant it doesn't really matter where you do it it's kind of wherever's community for you some people do slack Discord I like to talk to my VAs on Facebook some people do WhatsApp I talked to my thumbnail uh my YouTube thumbnail guy just on Instagram we've been working together for like a year my main video editor we've been working together for over 2 years and it's
really cool that we can go ahead and take advantage of the geographic Arbitrage and provide a job to someone and country that's significantly less expensive good money to them that isn't super expensive for us so it's actually a major win-win some people like to call using virtual assistance like exploiting people which I don't really get considering that if they didn't want to work for that amount of money they you know definitely wouldn't have to in terms of cost of how much virtual
assistant actually cost some people pay hourly or you can pay monthly typically somewhere between $300 to $700 but see what the VA is specifically looking for you know what I mean part-time Vaas are underrated as well specifically I'd recommend in terms of getting set up with a virtual assistant once you're around like 20 to 30k a month similar to a prep center right 500 it simply correlates to right around that it just really depends on kind of what's going on in your life as well some people share virtual assists where their
friends or get one around like 10K on the sale just cuz they're really planning on taking off it's really important to note though guys like you're going to have to train and talk to the VA all the time on zoom and stuff to make them good they're not just going to be good from the get-go even if they have experience it's going to take training now don't tell them all your sauce from day one but grow into it and overall if you can provide good situation for them the incentives align you're looking at having potentially
really good long-term employees that'll be incentivized to grow your business even when you're not working another really important thing is making the right virtual sist and job application this used to be kind of confusing and there are like lots of templates and stuff like that the cool thing is chat gbt can actually help you with that and lots of other stuff let's take a look now at how you can use chat gbt for Amazon FBA so there's five main ways I specifically like to use chat gbt for Amazon FBA like I mentioned in the
virtual assistance section it's really helpful for making a job application post so say we can type in like prompts like make me a Amazon FBA virtual assistant s product researcher job application for 46 bucks an hour 46 an hour 40 hours per week and then we can see it's going to go to work here making this job posting it's literally insane how helpful chap GPT can be with this stuff so we can see a application for virtual assistant here and we can see it's just typing away in terms of breaking this down I would
definitely add like you know edited as you see fit like for Arbitrage we want like seller andipa specifically here so we see it nice and personalizes it as as well so you'd copy and paste this into a Google doc and kind of fix it as you see fit a big Pro tip for virtual assistant job applications is pay the $7 a month for onlinejobs.
ph premium and then just cancel it once you don't need it anymore that promotes the crap out of your listing and gets a ton more eyeballs on it what I also like to do is add a specific caveat in the job application reply to this with your resume why you think you'd be good for the job and your favorite color that way you weed out all the people that didn't actually read the full job application and typically around like half of people actually do that that are good candidates so that helps you dig in further in terms of
finding the specific candidates then I like the idea of hiring two VAs on a paid week long trial to see which is better cuz it's really help if you can compare them as well next way I like to use chap GPT for Amazon Arbitrage is actually wholesale supplier Outreach so like write me a wholesale supplier Outreach email for a beauty brand I want to buy in bulk to sell on Amazon now I wouldn't necessarily recommend selling on Amazon or mentioning that in the first email to all seller here we're mainly talking
about online Arbitrage though but chat gbt is really helpful for that as well we can see deer suppliers name of suppliers total right it just templates things and makes your life a lot easier and such as we and see it's going to work terms of breaking the stuff down it can be just a really easy way to save mental energy in terms of doing some of the grunt work in terms of like stuff like this and everything we'd see we can see it's going to work in terms of hitting us with a basic template here in
terms of getting set up doing wholesale Outreach good Pro tip here if you're cooking online Arbitrage with a specific brand that's not like a huge brand and you can see sellers on that listing that have tons of use it's a decent idea to hit that brand up using one of these templates personalize it obviously and see if they'll sell you products wholesale as well third way I like to use chat DPT is customer service templat so all the time especially when you're doing fbm you're going to get emails
from customers saying that the package shows delivered on the tracking but they didn't actually get it so here's how we're going to deal with that using chat GPT so write me a response template for an Amazon customer who bought one of my items and the tracking number shows delivered but they said they didn't get it there's obviously a variety of customer service scenaries when this can make sense here but we can see boom makes it nice and easy rare and then the cool thing is when you're doing customer
service for Amazon FBA Amazon actually handles it fbm is where you do customer service and you really really rarely get a lot of messages and nice thing is you can use chat GPT to go ahead and just you know give you a decent template to use then you can actually save the template in the replies as well here so we can see dear customer check safe places contact the carrier Etc in terms of stuff might include something about like an a toz clan in there as well either way chat GPT really good for getting set up with basic templates with
the stuff here another good way to use chat GPT for Amazon is actually product ideas so what products sell best during summer on Amazon here right so now we get some ideas different niches and stuff and everything so it's going to be like kind of what you'd expect outdoor equipment sunscreen sporting gear travel accessories and such it's not a bad place to get ideas though that we can see it just you know pumps out answers here and it just makes your life a lot easier and such so finding prnis another
good way to use chat GPT another really good way to use chat GPT is going to be locating trade shows trade shows are places you can go and find wholesale suppliers in person I'll be at the ASD trade show in Los Vegas which is in early August this year I think so if you're in the Las Vegas area stop by and say what's up it's basically like probably the biggest Gathering of Amazon sellers throughout the year so let's see so show me trade shows in North America in 2024 here right we see sometimes it doesn't show like specific
like recent ones and such we'll see if it uh gives us any right here yeah here we go so it's got a decent amount of them right I'm sure it'll give us you know location specific ones if you wanted to find like in the Northeast and such specifity to but we can see I'm surprised ASD is not showing on here let's see what is ASD trade that's thing you can answer a questions you might put me out of business as a Amazon Seller educator as well boom yeah okay here we go so it breaks down what ASD Market week is such
I'm surprised that didn't show up in the initial trade show shirts but definitely utilizing chat gbt to find product ideas customer service you know wholesale Outreach locating trade shows as well can be really helpful and can save you a lot of time and those virtual assistant job applications as well as you know expectations and such you know pay contracts Etc you can use chap gbt for as well so there's some a lot of use cases here if you're not using chat gbt it's awesome try it out so now you guys know about
delegating your business through virtual assistant and prep centers I also want to show you guys my trajectory of how I scaled up my first year to share some lessons in terms of what you can avoid and what you actually want to do in the scaling process to see results quick this was my first trade sing 12 months my first 12 months is like 1.
1 million first calendar year which is right around like 10 months of fully selling was right around a million bucks in revenue and right around 160 Grand of profit I definitely could have been more profitable but I was learning as is anyone their first year so I got started in February 2021 basically I've been doing used books on Amazon for a while and then relatively unsuccessfully and selling shoes on the side also trying to do like smma as well I I was all over the place at the time right when I learned you could get ungated in like
under arour and indid stuff you know right from the ge-o I went ahead and placed the orders using Eastbay at the time which is now Champs got those enged and listed some of my old shoe inventory and like immediately stuff just started selling fbm which was crazy because I had only done FBA at the time used books I had made a shipment in like 6 months I think at that point and the shoe inventory just started selling quick and I was already building my personal brand at the time cuz I was such a big fan of Gary ve that I started just talking
about how I was doing online Arbitrage and Retail Arbitrage and previously done used books so I already knew a lot of Amazon people but was now doing alline Arbitrage and basically I had been posting a little bit about how I was starting to get sales and I was watching this Gary ve video and he was talking about how you need to respond to every comment and I was like all right Gary ve I'm not just going to respond to every comment I'm going to message and introduce myself to everyone who comments one of those people was Garrett
all out Amazon who I now do the buybox bandits podcast with we ended up connecting getting on Zoom that night and it was just immediately a good fit we started sourcing together every day buying and flipping the same products our buddies Danny and Jake joined the squad as well and for the next 6 months we absolutely lived breathed and sleep selling on Amazon and that second month after doing like six grand in Revenue like a th000 bucks profit the first month I did 30k Revenue which was like6 to $7,000 in profit and I was like
finally I have found my thing I just finished college early graduated early to Chase my Wi-Fi money dreams and was crazy how just in like the third month out of school stuff immediately clicked just pumping Merchant fulfilled no FBA at this time and then just kept going pretty much with it in April and did like 40,000 in Revenue which was and just got into a nice Rhythm just buying replanting stuff finding coupons certain sales were going on as well and online shopping was just growing absolutely crazy especially back then definitely
still is now but especially back then and we were just able to really see results quick just because of how much time we put into it we were working together buying and flipping the same products not worried about saturation just having a lot of fun on Zoom FaceTime and Discord trading leads trading opportunities and the best thing about working with a group that I met just for free on social media from not hiding was that I got to avoid all the mistakes that they were making and they got to avoid the mistakes I was making
so compounded our knowledge grew so quick and our businesses grew so quick as well I went on vacation in May of 2021 down to Florida to see my grandparents and because I was only doing Merchant fill at the time my business completely fell a little bit I think I did like three grand or like five grand or 10 grand or something like that cuz I I got back in the latter part of May but didn't really make a bunch of progress then was able to Source some good inventory and learn running the business remotely a bit little bit but a
big takeaway from that was that you need to do both FBA and fbm you can't just be doing fbm I got back home full speed in June and did about 50k in Revenue I started doing Retail Arbitrage as well at the Nike allet on top of the normal online Arbitrage I was doing to at the time and was getting really close to cracking a $10,000 profit a month and then was able to do that in July as back to school really got kicked off it was my first experience selling like 50 of the same thing in one day and that's
when it really opened up like holy crap I can really do some good stuff with this but then the same thing happened I didn't learn my lesson I hadn't started FBA enough and I went on vacation again down to Florida to see my grandparents and was able to go to the Miami sellers conference and actually meet a lot of other sellers in person for the first time which was super fun and it was also pretty cool to see all these people doing big numbers in one room and think damn that guy over there is doing 200k
am mon that guy over there is younger than me he's doing 100K a month already meanwhile I just had my first $60,000 revenue and over a $10,000 profit month so I got back inspired and a new man and like and right about on August 15th I turned back on my fbm listings and the back to school volume was absolutely insane I did over a 100K in Revenue in just the 2 weeks between August 15th and the of the month and it completely changed my life forever I still remember staying up till like 3:00 in the morning cuz that's when the Amazon day ends on
the Amazon seller app just refreshing it for sales to try and hit the first $10,000 Revenue day and a lot of what that month consisted of was my first time ever buying hundreds of one specific product in one time one thing beginners are afraid of is figuring out what websites are bulk friendly what websites order cancel it's all an experimentation process order cancels typically are avoidable just changing up your information a little bit which is is called jigging and some websites do let you buy bulk in 50 or 100 of one
product at one time so don't necessarily be afraid of a site order cancels immediately just give them a call and say hey why was this order canceled a lot of the time it's not that they're anti- reseller they're just a they're just looking to avoid people doing fraud to them which is perfectly reasonable and a lot of the time you can get your account whitelisted and then you're good to go to buy as much as you want cuz they do want to do business with you however some websites like Target for
example are a bit trigger happy with the cancels and do ban cuz they are anti reseller but the key to that first $100,000 month was finding a couple websites that I could absolutely hammer and taking advantage of pickup orders with Retail Arbitrage because of what was happening in 2020 and 2021 a lot of retailers added buy online pickup in store which meant I could Source online and then actually drive 20 minutes and pick up the item in store have it in hand same day get it listed FM same day or sometimes even sell it before which
is a little bit risky but once you're in the mix it can make sense and then ship those products out sometimes just the same day all those fbm orders as well that was an incredibly transformative time that's one of the reasons I'm so bullish on the space cuz I know what it can do for you cuz it completely changed my life going from just finishing College chasing my wifi money dreams to making over $15,000 profit in one single month in like six months September came and fbm dried up a little bit which led
me to switching over to FBA for September and October predominantly that was a little bit of a process to build up my inventory once again but as you guys can see I stayed pretty pretty much around that like $100,000 Revenue Mark and then November stuff got popping that's when demand really starts to pick up for the fourth quarter your pumping in FBA shipments all month as well as fbm starts to really take off too similar to how it does during back to school I did over 200k revenue for that month and over $330,000 profit but truth
be told I wasn't even noticing how much I was making I was just trying to get the fbm wars fulfilled for the next day buying heavy on Black Friday and early Black Friday says as well which I talked about during the source encounter section shows during those opportunities there's just tons of deals going on left and right you buy you get it in you fpm it then you restock it all you can you'll know when it's time to buy heavy on certain products because you sold a ton of it yesterday and then getting
into December it was just more of the same I had some like 20 $225,000 Revenue days for like $5,000 in profit right about 300K revenue and 55k profit for that specific month it definitely could have been more profit if I was Smarter with my pricing but it was my first year and you guys can see how important is to hit back to school heavy and to hit Q4 heavy and the nice thing is it's not like you're taking a bunch of risk buying a bunch of stuff and hope it sells well you're slowly testing and fbm
stuff cuz pretty much everything's fbm friendly during Q4 and then you're letting the market give you feedback in terms of what you should buy heavy on so the scaling process is a lot less like analyzing like market trends than it is just looking at data that's good buying it fbm it and buying more if it sells quick so my best piece of advice for the scaling process is find a couple websites you can really hammer and attack heavily and then maximize those all you can and get every Ed you can every coupon every discounted gift card
if they have a Rewards program maximize that if it's a smaller brand hit them up and see if you can buy wholesale and then also storefront stock off the sellers you see on your listings to find more adjacent listings which is called horizontally scaling leads tend to hang out around each other in terms of like other products in that brand or other brands of storefronts that are carrying that listing or selling or other variations of that product and just thinking where else there are other leads hanging out around here and
typically as you walk through doors more doors open that's how I scaled up and did over a million in Revenue my first year and completely changed my life make sure you guys let me know any questions in the comments and let's keep it moving so you guys just saw how I did my first year in the scaling process another thing you're going to want to use is a repricing software definitely not necessary from the GetGo and there are a bunch of good repricers out there I'm personally a fan of the BQ AI
repricer that I use in my own business as well and basically what a repricer does is it works to find the buy box at the highest prices possible specifically we can see here on bol's pricing page the basic version is just $25 a month what I like about the $100 a month is I can use unlimited AI in my listings I'm personally a fan of the AI equalizer and basically all you do with the repricing software is with the basic version just set to match buy box for the most part with the AI version I like setting a
minimum about right where I want to sell and I'll update that minimum as c fit cuz the market can change on stuff and then a maximum where the product has historically been in the past plus a little bit to see if I can get some upside there and then I like using AI equalizer more than like profit booster or sales maximizer specifically so if you're a new seller so if you're a new seller I'd recommend getting re pricer set up once you have like 10 plus asence live if you want a full tutorial that
I'll leave a link down below as well as an affiliate link if you do want to go ahead and use beill it makes sense around like 10 plus asent or from the get-go if you're really serious cuz it does help you get more buy Box share and every experienced seller does get a repricer once they're in the scaling process don't overthink it though guys once you have a couple asens live or if you're super serious from the GetGo watch my tutorial on beq in terms of getting it set up and start repricing on
listings and it should make a big difference now we're going to talk about using business credit to scale now I want to make it very clear for you guys you don't have to use credit scale and everyone has their own risk tolerance I personally use a lot of business credit to scale my business and it was really helpful however if you don't yet have a proven system you can totally get yourself into a lot of debt and make a lot of mistakes so this is obviously up to you in your own risk tolerance it worked really well for me but I'm just
personally sharing how I used it you need to audit your own risk tolerance my favorite form of business credit is business credit cards I'm going to share with you my three favorites and why I like them the first one is going to be the best business credit card for beginners which in my opinion is the ax blue business Plus or blue business cash depending on whether you want points or cash back the cool thing about this card is there's no annual fee so it's free to have and typically I think they have a
0% APR offer too which is really helpful as well but the big thing is it's just easy to get as a beginner and I've seen some pretty high limits with this card as well obviously though with the higher limit the higher of the RIS though so make sure you're good at the stuff priority using credit in my opinion or you just avoid it all together if you're nervous which is completely fine and there's a big difference between buying stuff on credit and then selling it quick merch filled the next day versus
buying stuff on credit shipping it off to the prep Center waiting for it to sell and so not all purchases are created equal and it's really important I think to understand that stuff and be open and transparent with you guys throughout this entire process my second favorite credit card is the Capital One spark card this is my favorite one purely on a benefits basis because it gives 2% cash back on everything I made like 40 Grand in extra cash back one year just using like my credit card cash back and then all the different cash
back ports we talked about as well there is an annual fee on this card I don't know if you need to have an LLC or not that's going to be on you to do your own research from my experience some business credit cards don't require an LLC I think some do though but you got to look that up on your own I had my LLC open by the time I got my Capital One spark card I would however recommend if you're going to do a Capital One card do the big one with the 2% cash back that does have the annual fee cuz that does
tend to have really good limits and that's been a fantastic card and it's where most my inventory spend goes these days the third option is the best for cash flow management and you still can get pretty high limits and it's going to be the AMX Plum card which has the 60-day payback period compared to a traditional credit credit card this gives you twice the time to pay back and this is one a lot of sellers used to scale with if of course that's something you're interested in I think there's
$150 annual fee something like that you'll see when you apply but the big thing with the plum is the benefits aren't as good but the big thing is the payback period getting that extra time is insanely helpful my favorite credit cards the AMX blue for beginners the AMX Plum for scaling and the Capital One spark for the 2% cash back overall best for benefits in my opinion there's tons of good business credit cards out there I just learned how to use business credit how to get them on YouTube videos
there's also some creative stuff you can do with credit card turning as well which is basically like taking advantage of different signup bonuses the nice thing is you can travel like crazy for free like I have a Hilton business card and utilizing the AMX points for my other AMX cards and and putting them towards spend on Hilton credit cards I got over 40 free Hotel nights in 2023 just for buying inventory so a side effect of selling on Amazon is you're going to get a ton of free travel as well if you use it correctly there's a
lot of cool business credit blogs out there that you can look into in terms of credit card turning and taking advantage of different bonuses so we just talked about business credit and how it can be a helpful tool to scale your business another thing that's really helpful and actually required in some cases is going to be what's called a reseller certificate so each state has a different name for this stuff I'd really recommend looking up like CPA YouTubers and stuff that actually you know are licensed to talk
about how this stuff works and everything basically it's a document you can get from your state that helps you avoid sales tax on purchases now this is going to be required for doing wholesale purchase when you open a wholesale account with a brand they're going to ask for your paperwork cuz it's a B2B transaction so you can show that reseller certificate at checkout with Retail Arbitrage to avoid sales tax not many places are going to allow it for online Arbitrage specifically that's why the prep Center model that we're going
to talk about works so well avoiding sales tax definitely getting a reseller certificate it's not going to be required for online and Retail Arbitrage but it can help in certain cases only a couple online Arbitrage we sites are going to take it Walmart's a great example of that if you want full like professional help on that look up like CPA YouTubers or how to get a reseller license in whatever state you live in and you'll find people that know exactly how to do it it was an easy process for me in Florida though I just filled out a
couple forums and then that resarch certificate came to me and now I can go ahead and use it for any wholesale purchase in terms of submitting it or bringing it with me to do Retail Arbitrage as well and avoid sales taxs there's different names for it in each date so look up some of those keywords on Google and you'll find best practice nice and easy don't think this one guys it's not required unless you're doing wholesale but it can be helpful filming this in May 2024 and back to school is fast approaching back
to school is one of the best times in the entire year for Amazon sellers and I want to make sure you guys are fully prepared so in this module we're going to walk through everything you need to know about back school important dates what products sell best when should you start buying how do you maximize profit shipping templates and getting the buy box with Merchant fulfilled important dates for back to school you'll really start to see demand increase in late June and especially in early July that
kicks off with July 4th the 4th of July when tons of retailers they're running big sales and then the week after that there's July Prime day as well typically every year and by that point we're in mid July and demand is really starting to pick up late July and early August is when demand really really starts to crank and when FBA competition starts to drop off which is really good when you can start to clean up and get some buy Box share Merchant fulfilled and just in general if you can see other sellers
selling merch filled on a prodct it makes sense you to test it on a 72-hour basis it really comes down to a listing by listing basis how fbm friendly a listing is August 1st to the 20th is Peak demand for back to school if if you're planning on going on any summer vacations but you also really want to take advantage of fbm make sure you don't do this during August 1st and August 20th biggest days are going to be between like the 5th and like the 12th but it's all going to be dependent on when you have good fbm inventory lot
during this time there's also going to be an incredibly good amount of fbm inventory that you can actually buy Retail Arbitrage from the outlets or online Arbitrage pickup orders as well getting stuff in hand same day is really helpful by mid September demand starts to cool off and we get pretty much back to normal but then once October kicks around we're in Q4 and demand starts to pick up once again my personal experience with back to school a couple years ago when I was just getting going I did like 60k in revenue for July and
then I was doing pretty much all Merchant fulfilled at the time and then I did exactly what you shouldn't do I went on vacation in early August but once I got home from vacation which was actually going to see my grandparents as well as going to a big Amazon Seller conference the Miami sell conference and I saw these guys all over they were doing huge numbers 100K 200k 500k a million a month on Amazon I was like if they can do it I can definitely do it so I came back inspired in a new man I got home August 15th turned my store off
vacation mode and demand was absolutely through the roof immediately I had my first 10K Revenue $1,500 profit day that week that last we period of August completely changed my life and while I was overwhelmed fulfilling fbm mors cuz I had pretty much no FBA inventory at this time it was insane to make money that quick and that's what makes me so bullish on back school the next year I did over 300K in Revenue during back to school as well so back to school is one of those times very similar to Q4 which we're going to talk about in a sec where
you can compress a lot of learning into one time period and really clean up especially with fbm on different products a question I'm sure you're thinking what products sell best during B school pretty much anything you could think would right backpack shoes clothing calculators school supplies as well as soccer football and volleyball gear as well you're going to let the data speak for itself though and that you can pretty easily see you know and go search like Adidas backpacks for example on Amazon and see everything
where the demand's really increasing and then go ahead and clean up on that inventory if you can find it profitable just make sure you use all those discounting methods you now know to use that's what's going to make stuff profitable some retailers are also going to have back to school sales as well and there's some good hidden clearance especially at Walmart typically every August as the seasons change so when should you start buying products for back to school personally I don't think you should buy and hold products and
expect them to be good I would much rather you wait for them to become good and then sell them quick fbm or get them shipped in FBA fast you'll notice especially during Q4 and back school I talk way more about fbm that's CU When demand really picks up for certain products competition goes down and there's a lot more buy Box share to go around specifically to fbm sers and that's how you can take advantage of it fast so I'd say start buying back to school stuff like July 4th July Prime day whenever listings you're looking at
start to become profal get them in if there's fbm SS on listing get them live fbm as quick as possible and if and if they're mainly FBA prodcts just get them off to Amazon as quick as possible and go find some more stuff the best way to maximize profits is going to be testing early and wide and then once you have purchase data on how good certain products were absolutely hammering them via FBA my best advice to maximize profits is testing early and wide being prepared for this stuff looking at what's performed best in past years
going ahead and trying to find those items profitable today testing nice and light and then once you get data back on different purchase and get feedback start hammering certain Nations that are proven and selling really well if you look at keyo charts in the past typically there's a lot of competition on certain products in Late July then it absolutely plummets in early and mid August and that's the type of stuff you should be looking for as well as low competition stuff that's profitable today a really important Pro tip if
you've never been able to do Merchant filled that successfully yet or if you're just pretty new to it is how important a role shipping templates play shipping templates are basically how much you charge for shipping and how quick you tell Amazon you'll ship your products out which affects how much buy Box share you get I'd recommend doing free shipping for economy and standard orders and then charging something like 20 or $30 per order plus a dollar per pound for next day expedited and two-day
orders cuz you don't want to get screwed if a customer places an order and you have the standard shipping templates in your Amazon because the last thing you want to do is pay $20 extra for fbm shipping on an order just cuz you didn't have your shipping template set up correctly so make sure you go to the top right on Amazon Star essential hit the gear menu hit shipping settings and then make your templates correct a pro tip though if you don't have that setup correctly and you've been getting
screwed by this in the past you can also buy shipping off pirate ship so if Amazon looks really expensive which occasionally it will even if your templates are set up correctly you can buy shipping on V or pirate ship then you just confirm the shipping over to Amazon I'd also recommend if possible being in zero day handling time shipping settings especially if you're newer to fbm that's basically saying that some orders depending on the cut off time you set you're going to ship same day which
Skyrock the amount of buy Box share Amazon gives you because it's a better customer experience to get the product sooner that's really helpful to start getting buybox share on different listings although in general competition tends to be low on stuff that's really popping during back to school and you are going to be able to get buy Box share fbm even in one day handling time on most listings you just might need to be a little bit more patient however if you're like me and you're really looking
to go hard with stuff I would consider being in zero day handling time because you're going to have to ship orders quicker and doing stuff other people won't gives you money other people can't get and I know you're wondering isn't Merchant fulfilled more work yes but it's also more money and it's a lot less risky if you're fping products you have to wait one to two weeks for them to get to Amazon and check in they might also FC transfer Merchant fulfilled you order that product from Kohl's it gets here
four days later you get that thing listed fbm as quick as possible make sure you have a ton of fbm shipping slies ready for back to school poly mailers maybe even big poly mailers for backpacks little boxes and bubble mailers for calculators and crayons and stuff like that as well all of that you can get at Walmart or Uline the biggest mistakes to avoid for back school is speculation around price listening to people online who have very mature businesses saying that fbm isn't worth it that already put in a ton of work
hustling that now don't have to fbm in my opinion you really should if you're a beginner it's going to help you learn quicker it's going to help you make money quicker it's going to help you avoid price tanking as well as not being active in the Amazon Comm me that made such a big difference for me over the years meeting masterminding and networking with other Amazon sellers selling the same products and stuff like that and then also buying heavy on unproven listings let the data speak for
itself in my opinion the only time you should Hammer something is when it's already selling really well for you and also just in general go look up some backpack listings some calculator listings some cray listings some soccer gear listings and just look at how the sales range plummeted last August and September get excited and be prepared to find that stuff profitable this year and make sure I want You guys fully prepared for back to school and Q4 so if you have any questions about this St please let me know Down Below in the comments as
well and let's dive into Q4 Master on Amazon so we just talked about best practice for back to school season now we want to talk about best practice for Q4 otherwise known as the fourth quarter of the year which is by far the best time of the year for Amazon sellers you want to be prepare to take as much advantage of it as possible and grow your business to the moon this Q4 and subsequent q4s in the future we're going to be going over my first experience my first Q4 when I did over 300K in revenue and over $50,000 in profit all the
important dates you want to know for Q4 Q4 Miss and mistakes that I want to make sure you guys avoid how to Source Products specifically for Q4 as well as Black Friday Cyber Monday which is the best weekend of the entire year for product research what items to Target what types of stuff sell best and when to Source them how to use past data to easily find tons of Q4 leads as well as common beginner mistakes to avoid repricing tis for maximum sales managing merch and fulfilled at scale which is really really helpful to look into doing
during Q4 as well as what supplies you need to have and just some overall tips to make your Q4 as Prof as possible now so the story of my first key FL so as you guys saw from earlier in the course I got started selling on Amazon specifically doing online Arbitrage back in 2021 and grew the business starting in February of 2021 and was able to do over 300K in Revenue just in December alone and over $50,000 in profit and the cool thing is by the time Q4 came around because I started earlier in the year I was fully prepared for the fourth
quarter and I really had no idea what to expect outside of just some people telling me that volume's going to pick up a lot but what I didn't expect was for all the products I bought during Black Friday when stuff's really really cheap to sell a lot quicker than I expected and to just get in this crazy rhythm of doing hundreds of fbm orders every single day so I would basically a order a ton of stuff for alline Arbitrage it would sell out really quick Merchant fi and then i' do my best to keep those products in stock and just
keep them moving and it was a never ending cycle of buying getting those items listed and then Merchant fulfilling them out and annoying my post office as much as possible some big takeaways from that first Q4 were just overall how much volume increases I had never done over like 110k in Revenue in one single month prior to November of 2021 and then in November I did about 200k 220 of Revenue and in December over 300K of Revenue and over $50,000 profit and that changed how I see money forever I had been told my whole life if I
wanted to get financi freedom I would have to work super hard for 30 years and not that I could just start a business and put in the right inputs and if I did the right thing and really really cranked up the dial and went hard with it that great things could happen fast I went from never having made $110,000 profit in one single month just six months prior to making over 50k in one single month and I want to make sure you guys are fully prepared to grow your business as much as possible this Q4 and for q4s in the future important dates to
know for Q4 so if you're unfamiliar the fourth quarter of the year is October through December why demand goes through the roof during this period is because there's a ton of holidays that happen and during holidays demand picks up and luckily the American Consumer loves to buy stuff and that provides a great opportunity for us as Amazon sellers Q4 begins at the start of October and right at the start of October at least last year for 2023 Amazon held another Amazon Prime day on top of the July Prime day
that they've held for the past couple years I think and hopefully that happens again this year in 2024 and future years because when Amazon does prime day a ton of retailers run competitors and that provides a great opportunity for us as sellers to buy a bunch of inventory similar to how July Prime day happens right before back to school for the most part October's relatively similar volume you're not going to see too much crazy stuff you're going to mainly be doing FBA during this time there are going to
be some Halloween sales as well some costumes and Cy and stuff like that's going to pop off but the big volume's going to start to kick off in November I didn't really expect this to be a thing if you would just ask me prior to starting to sell on Amazon I wouldn't say that early Black Friday sales were that much of a thing luckily there are a bunch of early Black Friday sales that happen in early November and that's a really good chance to get last minute FBA inventory they going to send into
Amazon that should be ready by pq4 volume later in November and December a big question I get with Q4 is when should you stop sending in FBA inventory and I'd recommend somewhere around like November 20th you should start to Pivot over to mainly fbm that's Sunday before Black Friday is when a lot of these deals starts to drop and products get insanely insanely cheap and by the time we hit like Thanksgiving demand started to pick up on stuff fbm and you have orders getting to you that you placed during Black Friday sales that you're
now getting listed fbm as well by this point I wouldn't really recommend sending in any more FBA inventory at least not the bulker business because it makes a lot more sense just to sell those products fbm the same day if you can and that comes from looking if other people are fbm on these listings the peak of Q4 really kicks off once Black Friday hits and then the real big days like if you're going to take any days off from your 9 to5 or anything like that are going to be like December 5th to December 20th is going to be the
really really Peak volume my biggest day of the past couple years has been either December 10th or December 12th as well but it kind of just depends on when you have stuff in stock fbm one thing that really comes in handy during this time period is you have to understand how inflated prices are and how much higher demand is and how much less competition there can be so it's really underrated to go out and do Retail Arbitrage during this time because you can get asens that have really low competition and that's
prices are really really inflated as well as pickup orders for Retail Arbitrage are insanely helpful as well after what happened in 2020 there's a ton of opportunity where you can actually Source your local retailers in store just doing it online which is really helpful and actually Place pickup orders and have that inventory waiting for you at the store that you can pick up same day and get listed fbm same day you'll notice as we go through more of this guys my main thesis during Q4 is getting as many quality fbm listings up
as quick as possible a big question I'm sure some of you guys are thinking is how do you know when it's time to buy heavy on a product because in my opinion that's where a lot of The Upside is during Q4 you'll know when it's time to buy 50 of something when you sold a bunch of them yesterday you're going to build that muscle over time hopefully if you're starting now you'll be prepared during Q4 but either way it's important like I've said throughout the free course guys to have a long-term mindset
and treat this as a learning process you're looking to build the skills over time another Pro tip is December 15th you want to increase your shipping template cost that now that customers are buying last minute stuff for Christmas they'll pay a lot more for increased shipping cost so that's a really good idea to take a look at and by late December volume starts to taper off a little bit after Christmas there is going to be gift card season so if the listing still moving well for you fbm you know if it isn't broke don't fix
it keep fbm in it and another Super common question I get all the time around Q4 is when to start sending FBA inventory back in and the Market's going to tell you on an as by as basis however you'll be able to see because volume's going to start to slow down price are going to recover to normal offer counts are going to start to go up as people start to restock their FBA inventory a big thing you guys need to understand is that fpm is a relatively new thing to be mainstream like we kind of started doing
it heavily and kind of broke all the rules we got going with the stuff guys like especially in like back to school my first year there's a lot of sellers that don't think fbm works and that's why the competition goes down the price goes up and the demand goes up like crazy during Q4 and it's a great idea to top on stuff fbm and then early January you're going to be back to normal for the most part FBA and stuff and everything nice thing is in early January as well there's a lot of good
Retail Arbitrage clearance season retailers are shifting prodcts they're offering those are the important dates for c for and then throughout the full free course guys please make sure if you you guys got any questions let me know down below I'll be in there answering all you guys questions okay some common myths you need to avoid for Q4 you'll hear some mature sellers saying they only do FBA and don't Michigan shw that advice that you can have this beautiful all FBA business from the get-go if
you're trying to maximize profits truth be told you don't need to do Merchant fulfilled at all there's no rules with this stuff do whatever you guys want build your own strategies however a lot of these sellers that are talking about delegation which we're going to talk on a little bit later and doing allf PA fbm not being scalable fbm not worth their time they have a lot more experience than you and they're a lot better at the skill so naturally they have more leverage when you're a new seller your
strength is in your flexibility it's in getting stuff listed quick and everything like that another big misconception is that TOS are the main thing you should focus on during Q4 the nice thing is demand increases like crazy on all types of stuff it doesn't have to just be toys pretty much everything pops off and the data is going to tell you what to Source your favorite suppliers are probably going to have better discounts than they ever do your favorite products are probably going to be going up in price more than
they ever have for that year and that's what you should continue selling in Q4 at least in my opinion just continue to double down so how should you source during Q4 I'd recommend keep going with what you normally got going but focus more on manual sourcing on your favorite suppliers websites because pretty much every website Under the Sun is running deals not just during Black Friday Cyber Monday but a lot of them are running deals throughout December and there's going to be tons of opportuni to use
Evergreen coupons on stuff that become a lot better because value vales go up on procs but the retail prices stay the same and there's less competition in December as well and just your normal storefront stalking or reverse sourcing like you I saw during the product research guides as well one thing I really like doing is if you see the value going up on a product or just see that it has in the past you can use the data buy box statistics on keepa to see who sold that product at the most expensive price or current sellers that
are on a listing if the price is going up those are smart sellers that are taking advantage of those price increases they're going to have other good stuff in their storefront for you to take a look at one really important thing you need to start doing now is keeping good organized seller amp Google Sheets we touched on this a little bit earlier but all the time you're going to see examples of prods that have gone to the moon in the past and you can go ahead and take advantage of that stuff specifically during Q4 if you have a big
seller and Google sheet full of different leads you have little notes on them and stuff during Black Friday when stuff's cheaper than ever it's going to be a great opportunity to take advantage of that inventory I'd recommend like I said also having spreadsheets for like back to school almost good types of items out of stock stock stuff cuz a lot of the stuff will become good during Q4 with increased demand decreased competition and increased price action one thing a lot of people know just a pro tip in terms of getting the buy box
merg fi is that it's on a listing by listing basis there's no blanket answer in terms like can I fbm a specific thing typically you're just going to have to find out and look at what other people are doing on that listing you can increase your chances of getting fbm buybox share using repricer and being in zero day handling time which is in your shipping settings which basically means that you have to to ship the products out quicker it also means Amazon gives you more buybox share which lets you get
faster sales and that's really helpful in my opinion to put in that extra work to get that extra output as well you can also FBA and fbm at the same time on the same Amazon store or even on the same asens which a lot of people don't know that's a massive hack to get a ton of extra buybox share if you buy something that's absolutely fire during Black Friday maybe send it in last minute FBA but you're seeing that there's people fbm as well and you can get more of it how fast can produ sell it's can you get
enough of it and doing FBA and fbm on the same listing at the same time is really really helpful and getting products listed quicker fbm and not needing to worry about them checkin FBA is a massive hack as well how do you navigate Black Friday Cyber Monday sourcing in my opinion the vast majority of that time should be spent manual sourcing on your favorite websites digging through your seller M Google Sheets and ideally getting on Zoom or Discord and talking to your other seller friends that you're masterminding and
working on this stuff with together you want to have a burner email address that's consistently getting fed deals from different websites so that you know other websites that have sales going on as well however by this point you should know some of your favorite spers or at least be tapped in the community enough to know about some of the different deals that are going on and be really prepared and excited to take advantage of that if you're not and maybe you're watching this video in the future and Q4
is coming up focus on storefront stalking especially on listings you can see that are going up in price all right major Q4 mistakes to avoid number one's going to be deviating Focus completely in my opinion you should just be doubling down on what really works doing more and better buying heavier own stuff as you're getting proof of concept that it's working well don't just deviate focus and try to do what everyone else tries to do which is sell toys number two is going to be not listening to data
in my opinion you should only be making data driven decisions and throughout this entire course I want you guys to understand you guys are going to build your own methods as you're getting into it I'm just sharing what worked for me listen to the data on different products and if something's selling really well it probably makes sense to consider buying more of it another mistake I see is not repricing enough it's really important that you take your pricing very very seriously especially as we get
into early December and mid December and eventually like the real crunch time like December 15th 20th there's a ton of opportunity to raise your prices which is incredibly helpful as well supplies to have you guys want to make sure you're stocked heavily on those free UPS labels as well boxes from Walmart and Uline for a variety of different products by this time you pretty much know the majority of stuff you'll be fbm you have a good idea of it and you can get box really easily if you ever need
to from Walmart but it does make sense to get stacked heavy on that stuff you want to make sure you have a bunch of FN skew labels as well nice thing is you can get this stuff last minute from Amazon or Walmart if you ever need to Amazon Prime comes in clutch for this kind of stuff when you need FM shipping supplies and you got orders that need to go out make sure you have a bunch of tape on Deck as well and there's certain big types of procs like backpacks and duffel bags that might require 19x 24 polymer as well like we touched on in
back to school so that'll be really helpful as well estimated fbm shipping costs are incredibly helpful these can change from time to time but here's what I'm personally seeing for my own fbm ERS this is what you're going to do when you scroll down on cell and toggle over to fbm ERS I would take notes on this as well you can see the weight of a product on sell amp and if something's between 1 and 3 ounces it typically ends up being in the $4 range to ship out if it's between four and 7even typically in the
5 550 range 8 to 11 ounces is going to be typically in the 550 to 6 range 12 to 15 o is typically going to be in the 5 and 1/2 to 6 and 1/2 type of vibe and then 1 to 3 lb are going to be going typically between like 9 and 13 occasionally these will be a little bit more expensive in terms of what you'll see when you're buying shipping on Amazon split test and go try pirate ship or vco which is vqo which are thirdparty shipping Services which are pretty helpful as well however over time like I said everyone lives in different parts
of the country you're going to dial in on what types of fbm shipping costs you're typically getting and it's really important to have those shipping templat set up correctly and be charging $30 plus a dollar per pound or something along those lines which will be really helpful as well another Pro tip for Q4 is utilizing USPS and UPS pickups via pirate ship which is a really helpful way you can go ahead and actually schedule to have them pick up your inventory a pro tip is if you have prepaid which is any type of fbm order
you can also make sure you're on good terms with your postp person because they come in handy with the stuff when I was doing you know a couple thousand order fbm days I'm going to the post office in the morning they're picking stuff up as well I'm dropping off in the afternoon T that I'm going to fulfill mors Q4 is when there's long hours and it makes sense to put in a ton of work work I would really really recommend going as hard as you can during Q4 and it's completely normal to do like 50% of
your annual volume specifically during Q4 as well so that's best practice for Q4 guys if you have any questions please let me know down below so we just talked about maximizing Q4 and one of the major mistakes I made in my own personal Journey was not maximizing Q4 and back to school and these other major seasonal opportunities that happen so I want to talk about some major mistakes I made in my own personal Amazon journey and how you can avoid them so the first major mistake I made was not hammering those big seasonal
opportunities because I didn't have experience it kind of makees sense why but I definitely could have put more time into those really heavy opportunities and I would have made more profit if this is your first back to school or your first Q4 it's really important to dig deep and work long hours cuz your time is a lot more profitable during Q4 and during back School versus other times of the year cuz you get more profit for one hour invested when items are selling a lot quicker and selling it a lot higher
prices and the competition is a lot less and a lot more items are profitable during seasonal opportunities than not it's the same thing with proct research during a holiday versus product research on a random Tuesday in January when a lot of sales are going on a lot more items are profitable and when the opportunity is hot you got to step up to the plate and knock it out of the park another big mistake I made was only doing Merchant fulfilled like my first 6 months when I eventually had to transition over to FBA it took me a
little bit while to kind of build up and learn the systems and I would have been able to move a loot quicker if I had been doing FBA on the side the whole time instead of doing like 99% merch and fulfilled there's more competition in the market these days so you're probably not only going to be able to do fbm I love the idea of doing fbm as a beginner as you guys have seen me say certain Nations you are going to have to FBA though and that was just a personal mistake I made that would have helped me
move a lot quicker if I had been doing both the entire time I get asked all the time by beginners should I do fbm should I do FBA I'd highly recommend doing both the third one is building a good leads database you guys saw how to use keepa alerts and seller amp spreadsheets so I'd really really recommend getting that stuff set up cuz all the time you're going to come across products that used to be profitable or are profitable a few times a year that aren't profitable today but it's a no-brainer with an
evergreen coupon that it can become good so that's something I personally didn't do that I definitely think you guys should do I do think I did a good job of putting myself out there but I could have always done more every year it feels like I post more content on social media I'm talking more Amon Sellers and opportunity just starts to pop up left and right so a mistake I made was not putting myself out there enough starting making YouTube videos starting getting on Zoom with every seller I could
earlier it would have made a big difference if I put more time into that that's why I recommend you guys get on social media or get on Discord or Reddit or wherever and talk to as many other Amazon sellers as possible and opportunity just pops up left and right after helping tons of coaching students I can typically tell how successful another Amazon Steller is going to be based on who they're talking to after a couple months cuz unfortunately some sellers aren't talking to anyone which Dooms them to have to find all the
opportunity on their own make all the mistakes on their own and overall move a lot slower and have to put in more time compared to the seller that's working with his buddies on Discord and on zoom and it's having a lot of fun with it and finding more opportunity and number five was actually diversifying my inventory every time my Amazon business has grown quick it's come from hammering coras and it's easy to get shiny objects in when you see people talking about all different types of products grocery pet
supplies Nike Lego Under Armour whatever I've gotten the vast majority of my results using the 8020 rule which is the idea that 80% of your results come from 20% of your inputs 20% of your products produce 80% of your profits 20% of your suppliers produce 80% of your leads so on and so forth and that's crazy true and I believe that more and more every day so don't listen to everyone's talking on social media play your game figure out what works and stick to it if Retail Arbitrage is cooking keep going
with retail Arbitrage if online Arbitrage is cooking keep going with online Arbitrage if one supplier is really really cooking for you store Front stock those other Sellers and find other adjacent suppliers and keep hammering that one spli once you start walking through these doors more doors open so those are some major mistakes I made and I hope you guys avoid them one of the tough Parts about sell on Amazon is you probably don't know anyone in person who sells on Amazon and you might not know anyone in person that
does online business business in general I'm from a small town in Pennsylvania it was the exact same case for me and one of the really important things I did was get really deep into the Amazon community and document my journey on social media which led to me making a bunch of friends online and and having a lot more fun and a lot easier of a Time building my Amazon business in general I can't emphasize enough the value of the Amazon community see Peter right here he got started a year ago he made 50k
profit in one single month his first month these are a lot of my coaching guys r as well we see Mason right here he had $10,000 profit months in his first six months Max right here so max actually moved on to a bunch of priv label stuff after getting $50,000 in profit Plus in his first year with online and Retail Arbitrage Max right here you guys know Max he's great on social media he has the prep Talk podcast as well with Peter he had a $50,000 profit month in his first year and all these guys did this working
together in a group chat we had having a lot more fun than the average seller I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get in the community and network we hear all the time your network is your net worth and it's so true for Amazon selling as well this is back at the Miami Amazon SE comments here there's Jazz hustles I'm sure some of you guys are watching her YouTube videos as well my boy Fields a profit right here and documented my journey on social media was able to connect me to Al who
started seller app and now I'm a part owner of the company as well I've been able to meet so many valuable connections create multiple sources of income and having an a lot easier time building my Amazon business as a result of the relationships with other sellers I built online this was actually last month at Garrett all out Amazon's wedding there was a great Amazon Seller turnout to support our boy and the Beautiful Thing is these are people from all over the country Cory's from North Carolina Nick's from Pennsylvania
Jimmy's from Utah Peter's from Wisconsin Danny's from New Jersey Warner's from Wisconsin Joe's from New York Max is from Massachusetts I've met most of these guys in person less than 10 times but we talk every day building our Amazon businesses together and the scarcity mindset says Oh no you're going to saturate the market when that's the same person who doesn't know a single person who does online business and the only person he talks to about selling on Amazon is his wife who doesn't think
it's going to work meanwhile well-connected sellers are being active in the free Discord that's linked below meeting other sellers on Twitter and Instagram documenting their Journey leading to further opportunities really important networking Pro tips document don't create you don't need to be making Fancy videos like I am when you're a new seller what I have noticed is the more I share the more opportunity finds me a lot of sellers will say oh I don't have time for networking I don't think you
have time not to cuz otherwise you'll have to make all the mistakes on your own find all the opportunity on your own and in general it'll be a lot less fun and it might just be you banging your head on the computer screen sometimes meanwhile from day one I was super active documenting my journey on Instagram and later on Twitter so I had group chats I was talking to week one that made the process a lot more fun and a lot easier well connected sellers have more fun find more leads and have to work less you have to understand
opportunities are everywhere and people create opportunities and if the only only people you talk to are the couple people from work and a couple dudes you went to college with that severely limits your talent pool of people to get rich with meanwhile everyone is on the internet and basically no one's putting stuff out that's not just to impress people that went to high school with so if you take the time and invest time and resources into being active and just being in the community being the mix really being at the lunch table with
other Amazon hours opportunity has no choice but to find you over a long enough time Horizon podcasting affiliate mark in lifelong friendships and less mistakes there's a reason we've done 150 plus episodes of the buybox bandits podcast available on all platforms with other Amazon sellers and and every single one says the community is so important that they have friendships and relationships with other Sellers and with suppliers that makes the process a lot more worthwhile a lot easier and a lot more profitable basically no one has
more context over what it takes to build a successful Amazon business than not and all the time I see people who are documenting their Journey on social media from day one and people flock to help them and then people who have been at it a couple years that have a lot harder time because they have no relationships and they have to make all the mistakes and find all the opportunity on their own my best recommendations is get in the Amazon Ser Community document your journey get uncomfortable and good things happen if
you stick with it and stay consistent and I know someone's going to say oh I'm not a social media person one I would never give labels to myself that didn't help me get what I want and two you got to change to change I didn't like doing at the start either but it led to me building a seven figure business my first year and created lifelong friendships is it necessary absolutely not is it uncomfortable absolutely do most of the good things in life come from being uncomfortable yes and making friends in the Amazon community was a
massive thing that shortened my learning curve helped me avoid mistakes and overall helped make more profit faster speaking of getting active in networking in the community if you're looking for personal direct one-on-one access to me and want more help grow your Amazon Miz I do have a mentorship program where we'll work together one-on-one to help you start or grow your Amazon Miz in 2024 a lot of the people you see talking about Amazon FB on social media actually originally were one of my students the last couple years

first steps guys is going to be getting your Amazon seller account set up make sure from there you go ahead you get a free trial of seller amp and a keepa subscription so you can start finding products you're also going to want to order your free shipping supplies from ups and USPS as well as basic polymers tape boxes and either 30 up label paper or FN ski labels depending on if you're using an old school printer or a fancy label printer from day one you'll need the FN ski labels from Amazon if you are
using the fancy printer for FBA you're going to need the 30 up label paper from Walmart if you're using an old school printer like I was when I would have to take it to the College library with me once your account is verified and Open start doing the auto onates like like I said the link to the auto unate list is down below and ordering a few Big Brand Products to get ungated with invoices I'd also recommend hitting up your local Ross Marshalls any Outlets you got nearby grocery out or alies and start
scanning stuff to start getting some reps in and if there's some good Auto on gate stuff get it listed live as soon as possible however if you find something in store and you are gated I'd recommend ordering that product online to get ungated even if it means you're breaking even a little bit however if you find a product in store and you're currently G I'd recommend ordering a cheap product from that brand online to get that order confirmation email to get unated then get going and start finding some online
Arbitrage stuff via the storefront stalking method and find your first few test units and get them up FBA or fbm as soon as possible also guys make sure any questions you have please let me know down below I'll be replying to all questions in the comments and there'll also be some other Amazon SS and just members of the Amazon community that I'm sure are down there as well keep up to date with my content make sure you subscribe for more free Amazon value and like the video if you liked it make sure
